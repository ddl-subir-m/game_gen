Welcome to 'Pac-Land' for the NES, released by Namco in 1985.

This is a port of the Arcade game, yet it is slightly different. The basics are
more or less the same, but levels have been changed among other things. The
other ports such as MSX and TurboGrafx-16 are also all different and worth
checking out if you are a fan of the series.

Suggestions, comments or errors - tell me about it. Enjoy!

02.)                    BASICS                                       G0200
===============================================================================

Pac-Land consists of 16 levels, divided into four trips, in which you simply
run from one side to the other and avoid enemies and jump over obstacles.
Sounds like your basic platformer, but it comes with Pac-Man style features.
Each level has a Power Pellet for you turn the ghosts into eatable ones and you
may devour them. Additionally there are tons of secrets to be found. Once you
beat all 16 rounds the game will continue but simply restart from the first
round.

Even though there are two player controls, this is a single player game. There
is no taking turns either, it is simply about having the choice of two control
types.

For Player 1>
A        Move Right
B        Move Left
D-Pad    Jump, tap to run

For Player 2>
Right    Move Right
Left     Move Left
A/B      Jump, tap to run

I highly suggest you play as Player 2 because the controls are so much more
like a platformer. I myself got very confused trying to get used to the P1
controls, but maybe that's just me...

Pac will always be in the center of the screen, usually around A unless there
is an elevation of some kind, or an obstacle.

SCORE is your current score. See more about under scoring.

The round circles underneath the score is the time left to complete the level.

You get extra points depending how much you have left, but when you run out you
enter a TIME OUT stage. During this time the Sue ghost will move much faster
and you lose your bonus items (Helmet or Balloon).

HI-SCORE is the top score of the game, but it is only kept for the current
time. If you switch off the console this is lost.

On the right there are small Pac-Man icons to show your current lives. Die and
you lose one.

ROUND indicates the current level, naturally. Note that after round 16 it will
continue counting, but it really is round 01 again. This loop continues
forever, going into the hex numbers and finally ending up at infinite 0s.


Enemies:
````````
There are four ghosts you are probably very familiar with from other Pac-Man
or Namco games:

Clyde (Orange)
Pinky (Pink)
Blinky (Red)
Inky (Blue)

These four ghosts are always in vehicles. There are three types of vehicles:

Airplane. Usually it just goes in a straight line, and slow-moving. However
	  some daredevil pilots may decide to take a quick dive - be careful.

Pogo-Stick. Hop and bounce around like crazy. Can be very annoying and slow.

UFO. Flying up and down, a bit like the airplanes but more dangerous.

There are also small monsters that get dropped from airplanes. They disappear
when they hit the bottom of the screen. They are, however, equally hazardous to
your health. Once you have the helmet you can eat these guys for points.

Sue is the dark blue ghost. She follows you through the level so you don't
slack off and sit around.

Once you have eaten a Power Pellet all these ghosts turn into dark blue ones.
You can eat them for points, and they will be gone. When you fail to eat them
within a few seconds they will run away.


Obstacles:
``````````
Hydrants, Logs and Cactuses. Jumping on them may reveal a secret item, and if
they are movable then shift them all the way to reveal something even better.

Clouds go up and down and you can use them to gain higher ground.

Rotating logs speed up or slow down your movements in one direction. They might
drop you off to your death if you aren't careful enough. Keep moving!

Trampolines are used for far jumps. They can be tricky to get the hang of.


Items:
``````

Helmet. With the helmet equipped you are no longer in harm from the small
        ghosts. Even better, you get 300 points for each small ghost you catch!
        Available in Level 1, 5, 8 and 13.

Balloon. Worth 7650 points.
         Available in Level 4, 8, 12, 16.

Boots: Enables you jumping higher, and even higher as much as you want by
       simply pressing the jump button while you are still in the air. This is
       a gift from the princess.
       Available in Level 4, 8, 12, 16.

Flowers. There are four different kind of flowers. Purple drops down when you
	 have run out of time and the TIME OUT has begun. It is worth 300
	 points.
         Collect three Yellow flowers for an 1UP power-up.
         Orange flower falls from the sky after rotating the logs for more than
	 four seconds. It is worth 1000 points.
         Red flower...

S-Pac, 1 UP. Gained after three yellow flowers are collected.

L-Pac, all your time is refilled. After eating a Power Pellet you must eat four
ghosts, then eat Sue as the fifth. This icon will appear as reward.

Power Pellet: This is required to turn the evil ghosts into harmless ones so
              you can eat them up for points. The more ghosts you eat in
              succession the more points you get. When you are around the
              Pellet you may want to try and lure some more ghosts in to the
              area so you can get them in one swoop, as well as Sue who is most
              likely on your tail.


Scoring:
````````
As you may have noticed, simply walking along gives you 10 points per step.

Collecting items are worth points. There are three types of fruit that change
in value with each one you pick up, then it reverts to the initial one.
Cherry: 100, 300, 500, 1000 points
Strawberry: 300, 500, 1000, 1500 points
Apple: 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 points
Fruit pop up once in a while as you walk along, but may also be triggered by
standing on a scenery object, such as a fire hydrant.

Helmet: 1000 points

Once you have the Power Pellet you can eat ghosts. With eat continuous bite
you get extra points:
1st:   200 points
2nd:   400 points
3rd:   800 points
4th   1600 points
5th:  3200 points
6th+: 7650 points

After the round ends you are in the 'BREAK TIME' area. You will walk along and
soon the screen stops and the next round stars. Before the screen stops you
have the chance to jump. Depending on your status when the screen stops, you
get bonus points.
Slightly off the ground:  10 points
Half-way off the ground: 100 points
Mid-Air:                 300 points
Just about to land:     1000 points
Perfect landing:        7650 points


Secret Warps:
`````````````

They exist, but I don't really know where. They seem quite complicated to
activate and I haven't really heard much in detail. If you know specifics and
can show me (gameplay footage?) then I would love to hear from you.


Cheats:
```````

Infinite Lives: Set 003F at Value 5
Infinite Time:  Set 0093 at Value 8

Remember to switch off the time cheat after you have completed the level,
unless you want the bonus point counter to go on forever. Nice way to "cheat"
the high score I guess.


===============================================================================
03.)                    WALKTHROUGH                                  G0300
===============================================================================

For the hidden secrets you have to look at your current score and the current
hi-score to calculate where it is. This is quite simply. Take the last two
digits of the score (e.g. 30) and the last two digits of the hi-score (e.g. 20)
and get 30+20=50. This will determine where they are hidden, in this case the
Item (Balloon or Helmet) is at 1 and the Flower is at 4. The complete list for
every round, keeping in mind that the items are only available in certain
levels and that some levels do not have any hidden things at all:

o-------------------o
| No.  Item  Flower |
|-------------------|
|  00    2     1    |
|  10    4     2    |
|  20    3     4    |
|  30    2     3    |
|  40    4     2    |
|  50    1     4    |
|  60    3     1    |
|  70    2     3    |
|  80    2     1    |
|  90    4     2    |
| 100    3     4    |
| 110    2     3    |
| 120    4     2    |
| 130    1     4    |
| 140    3     1    |
| 150    2     3    |
| 160    2     1    |
| 170    4     2    |
| 180    3     4    |
o-------------------o

For the reason above, it is not easy to write a step-by-step walkthrough.
Another one is that while you walk back and fourth through the level, the
enemies will not come at you the same way. If you backtrack for a few seconds
and then continue on, there will suddenly be three ghosts coming along whereas
there might have been nothing if you simply continued on earlier. However, I
will describe the hidden locations of the items and flowers as you go through
the levels.


****TRIP 1****                                                       G0310


ROUND 01:

As you start, jump over the first hydrant. The next hydrant you see is 1. If
you have just started the game then you will have your score at 00 and the hi-
score is 30,000. Thus, this is where you will find a flower after moving it to
the left. Continue on and, again, if this your first game you will find a
helmet when moving this 2 hydrant. The next two hydrants on the way are 3 and 4
respectively. Watch out for the crazy flyer just before 4, he will swoop down
on you. Moving on, after five more hydrants that aren't special in any way, you
will see the Power Pellet slightly up in the air. It's small so don't miss it.
If you run ahead you will find a few ghosts. This is nearly the end of the
level already.


ROUND 02:

As you walk along, there are two logs next to each other. The first one is 1.
When you leave the trees there is a lone log, which is 2. The one after
re-entering the trees is 3 already. Run along to see a flying cherry in front
of you. Hunt it down to make a whole row of them appear. The log here is also
4. When you come to next clearing, grab the Power Pellet in plain sight and
dash through the rest of the level.


ROUND 03:

Climb the mountain and carefully jump over the rotating bridge parts. The next
mountain has three rotating logs you have to carefully jump over. Before the
last one you will find the Power Pellet, you can hardly miss it. The goal is
down the hill.


ROUND 04:

It certainly looks like the previous level backwards, but it has some slightly
differences. When you are up the mountain you might be wondering where the logs
are to get across. You have just received magic shows in the Fairy Land so you
can use those to multi-jump across the gap. Be careful of the oncoming planes.
Down the mountain you will find some logs. The right one is 1 and as you go
along they will be 2, 3 and 4. The final mountain has the Power Pellet in
mid-air. The goal is down the hill.


****TRIP 2****                                                       G0320


ROUND 05:

You need to get your precision jumping in order starting from here on out. Also
make sure you get plenty of a run-up to make it across longer gaps. You can use
enemies or Sue to get up to higher ledges if needed. After two jumps there are
two cactuses. They are both 1 and 2, but it seems you can only get one and not
the other. After two more jumps there is a long cactus number 3. There is a
short bit of dry land, and up on the next demolished building is the last
moveable cactus 4. The Power Pellet is on the tiny bit of ruin and you cannot
miss it. The rest of the jumps are nothing new and the dry land coming up is
already the goal.


ROUND 06:

Start walking and the small cactus after the bush is number 1. Jump over the
stacked cactus (large one) and find number 2 behind it. Take a long run up to
the trampoline and jump near the end of it. It's a little tricky if you are
new to the game, so practice this a bit if needed. The running part is very
important, and it's too bad some annoying ghosts like the swirl around in this
area a lot. On the other side of the pool is the Power Pellet, a good jump
will automatically pick this up in mid-air. The next cactus is number 3. Do
another running jump to get across the pool, but this one is much smaller. The
first cactus after the water is number 4. A few more desert screens and the
goal is reached.


ROUND 07:

The second log on the path is number 1. The fourth is number 2 and the one just
before the clearing is 3 already. The one right after the clearing (not the
one still in it) is number 4. That's is for all the secret stuff. You will find
the Pellet in the third clearing and apart from multiple enemies there is
nothing more to say here.


ROUND 08:

Back in town, there is nothing much for the start. After a long line of medium
houses, there will be another large one with a hydrant in front. This hydrant
is number 1. The next three are numbers 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Don't forget
to pick up the Power Pellet between the last two, it's quite far up but not a
problem with your recently acquired magic boots.


****TRIP 3****                                                       G0330


ROUND 09:

Before the clearing there are two possible hidden things: the second log is 1,
then last one is 2. In the second forest area you can move the tall log is 3 is
your lucky number, else the last one is 4. There is a flying apple like the
fruit you saw earlier, if you manage to catch it you will find a few more pop
up around the area. The Power Pellet is at the start of the last forest area,
it's a little higher up.


ROUND 10:

Climb up the mountain and time your jump onto the rolling logs so you can
quickly jump to the next ledge. If you land on this it will most likely take
you down into the abyss within a couple of seconds. When you make it across you
will be rewarded with log location 1 and 2. Use the cloud to get across the
ledges and find logs 3 and 4. This next rolling log platform is much easier to
navigate across, but make sure you do a long jump to the high ledge afterwards
as the low ledge is a trap. Soon you will reach a pool with small wood pieces
floating back and forth. Take it easy here, it is not too hard but can be
frustrating. Just when you thought the worst is over, the next pool has even
smaller wood pieces, or rather turned over ones. Run/jump across the rotating
bridge and grab the Power Pellet above the chasm. Jump far towards the moving
logs and then you just have to run down the hill to finish this hellish level.


ROUND 11:

From the first building jump to the small ledge, then to the next building. It
has two cactuses, they are both 1 and 2 but once again you can only move one.
Continuing on you will soon find the Power Pellet on a small ledge. The block
after this has the third secret cactus, and two buildings later you will find
no. 4. You want to be careful of oncoming flyers here, they often get you in
bad situations while you are stuck on a narrow platform.


ROUND 12:

Another pool level, but fortunately this time you can simply fly over all this
rather use any trampolines. But first, the lone cactus at the start contains
hidden item number 1. Now start flying and be careful of the all the foes that
like to float around here. There is a short break in the water, enough for a
cactus between two bushes that is hiding no. 2, then it's back to flying
across the second part. On the other side you will find cactus 3 and 4 on the
ground and the Power Pellet high up near a cloud.


****TRIP 4****                                                       G0340


ROUND 13:

Ruin level, you know the drill by now. The first building has a cactus which is
1 (the higher one), the second one has 2, the fourth has 3 and the sixth has 4.
Easy enough to see as it goes building-ledge-building and so on. The Power
Pellet is just at the end of the level, in the last ruined building.


ROUND 14:

You will see cactuses lined up near the start, and all but the last one are the
hidden spots. You can guess which order they are in...because as usual they are
1, 2, 3, 4. The rest of the level is just water. Head up onto the large cactus
near the edge of the water and wait for an airplane to come across. Board it
and fly along for a few seconds. Soon you will see some clouds. Jump on the
first one and then follow the linear platforms towards the rotating logs. These
can be tricky, wait for them to get a little closer. When you descend you will
see the Power Pellet, which will get rid of the ghosts that hover above. Jump
on the next few clouds and the large gap needs to be bridged by jumping on one
of the planes. Jump down to the trampoline and make it far to the next logs.
This is the last part of this tough level.


ROUND 15:

Climb up the mountain and use the cloud to get even higher. The first log you
come across is also number 1 for hidden stuff. Time your jump REALLY well over
the rotating logs, because if you do not you will land in the water and die.
The log after the water is number 2. After a few easy ledges you will see the
Power Pellet next the number 3 log. There are a few small puddles to cross, but
with a good running start you can jump right over them. The log in the middle
of the water has the last log though, if you are up for number 4. The last
chasm is a dead-end until a ghost catches up with you that you can use as a
ride across.


ROUND 16:

This is the easiest level, even easier than the first. You have magic boots to
fly around, but you can also just dash through if you aren't interested in
collecting many points. All the ghost vehicles drop flowers worth 1,000 points
each. You can stay as long as time permits. Just one note: do not get stuck on
a roof by mistake, the enemies still kill you when flying into you.


Now the game returns to the same round as Trip 1, so read up if want to play on
using the walkthrough.

However, you can consider this game beaten already at this point.
