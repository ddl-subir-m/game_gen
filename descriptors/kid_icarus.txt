*Introduction*

Kid Icarus comes from the Greek myth about a boy who made wings out of 
feathers and wax. Unfortunately, he flew too close to the sun, melted his 
wings, and fell to his doom. In the game you don't have to deal with these
events. Instead, you must defeat Medusa and rescue Palutena from the Palace 
in the Sky.

Like Super Mario Bros. and Metroid, Kid Icarus is one of Nintendo's first 
games. However, it is also one of their least successful games. It is unlikely
that an N64 sequel will be developed anytime soon (if ever). But if you 
haven't completed the original version of this classic, now is as good a time 
as any. Featuring some recycled graphics from Metroid (or is it the other way 
around?), not to mention the same annoying password system, Kid Icarus is a 
challenging and engaging action-adventure.

Pit starts out pretty weak. His life doesn't last long, and his attack power
is extremely limited. It's also difficult to heal yourself because items 
are so expensive and in short supply. As if getting through a stage wasn't 
enough, Pit's endurance isn't refilled between levels. As you get familiar 
with the game, though, you'll learn to deal with Pit's shortcomings.

This FAQ will help you on your quest to defeat Medusa, but it shouldn't be 
read casually. Since it is very thorough, you will be able to learn anything 
you need to know by reading it. Therefore, using it when unnecessary may 
reduce your enjoyment of the game. I'm sure all the tips, strategy, and hints 
are applicable for all the quests in the game. There are at least 3 quests 
(or three different endings if you will), though they are all identical, save 
for a few differences (mentioned below). Until you've seen all the endings, 
you can't consider Medusa down for very long. Check out the Unsolved Mysteries
section after you've mastered the game to see if you can help me out with the 
FAQ. Happy gaming.

General Strategy & Tips
*Play Control*

Practice your moves in the early stages. If you find yourself slipping off 
platforms and ledges because of the imperfect play control, try pressing the 
control pad in the opposite direction that you're traveling, or else press up 
on the controller. This works particularly well on ice.

It will take you a little while to get through certain rooms in the fortresses
without getting hit. Study the pattern and move. In the vertically-scrolling 
areas, don't jump to higher ground unless you're business is done at lower 
levels. You may inadvertently scroll an important area off the screen (perhaps
a chamber or item).

*Fighting Enemies*

When fighting the enemies in the game, you'll want every advantage you can 
get. If they are standing above you on a platform, open fire on them from 
below. Also try shooting enemies in the back (this works especially well with 
the Reaper). Both methods reduce your risk of getting hurt by projectiles and 
direct contact with monsters. Note that the Mallet is much more powerful than 
your bow and arrow (it has the power of 5 arrows), but they are in short 
supply so use them sparingly.

Don't try to muscle your way through the game. Sometimes you should stay in 
one spot practicing your moves and collecting hearts before moving on as you
fight wave after wave of monsters. Battle as many enemies as possible to 
increase your strength. Hide under ledges scattered about in the game and 
attack enemies from there. If you are feeling overwhelmed, duck into a
chamber. Your enemies will be gone when you return.

Don't bother to fight Pluton and Pluton Fly (they are invincible, after all). 
The best thing you can do is avoid them. If they make contact, they will steal
your weapons (which is quite inconvenient, although you can buy them back at
the Black Market). Wait until Pluton gets close and leap over him. Take care
of Pluton Fly by jumping straight up (so that he can see you). This will cause
him to fly horizontally off the screen. 

Killing enemies can be difficult and tedious, but your job gets a lot easier 
when you have the Protective Crystal. If enemies are raining down on you 
(Rockman, for example), stand in a safe spot and let your Protective Crystal 
do all the work. Then collect the hearts. Creatures that burrow in the ground
(like McGoos and Holers) are also good prey. Simply wait in an area 
that is infested by these monsters and crouch (to avoid their shots). Don't 
duck on ledges that aren't solid! If you are close enough, your Protective 
Crystal will kill the creature. Now just slide over, collect the hearts and 
keep doing this over and over to build up your experience. 

A slight problem emerges when you acquire the Sacred Bow. You'll be able to
shoot your arrows much further, but if you shoot up, there is a chance that 
any hearts that appear will remain suspended in mid-air where you can't reach 
them. Keep this in mind when you are low on hearts.

*The Marketplace*

To lower the prices that merchants charge, press A+B on controller 2 at the 
same time while in a store. This will only work in Stores; not at the Black 
Market. Unfortunately, 1/5 times you try this, the merchant will RAISE prices
instead. Too bad you can't attack merchants like in Zelda, eh? *If you have 
completed the game at least once, *ALL* merchants (excluding those in the 
Black Market) will lower their prices, so you can use this trick without 
worrying about higher prices.*

Although the Black Market is expensive, there are some advantages. You can 
buy items stolen from Pluton and Pluton Fly (Protective Crystal 700; Fire 600;
Sacred Bow 500) here. You can also buy on credit (after you have found the 
Credit Card, of course). Unfortunately, you cannot buy anything else until you
have paid back what you owe (it's automatic, and there is no choice of payment
plans).

You can buy multiple things at the Store, but not at the Black Market. If you
want to purchase more than one item at a store, simply wait for the merchant 
to prompt you again with his sales pitch. If you leave, the store will be 
closed forever. (All chambers are accessible only once, except when in the 
fortresses). 

*Treasure Room Cheat*

After you break seven of the pitchers in the Treasure Rooms without making the
God of Poverty (Reaper) appear, you can break the eighth pitcher to find a
valuable item. All the treasures will disappear if Pit sees the God of 
Poverty. You need 5 hearts to break a pitcher. The Reaper appears in a set 
pattern, and with this key you will be able to unlock the secret of that 
pattern.

Break pitchers 1, 2 and 8 in the Black Rooms.
Break pitchers 2, 6 and 7 in the Blue Rooms.

Given the number of Big Mallets that appear, you will be able to find the
exact position of the Reaper. Break all the remaining pitchers, leaving the
one with the Reaper until last. When you break this, it will reveal a special
item, ranging from a bottle to the elusive credit card.

*Navigating the Fortresses*

- You can't use your special weapons inside the fortresses. Only the Mallet 
  and regular Bow and Arrow can be used.
- Use the mallet on the statues in the fortresses to rescue Pit's friend. Now
  you can fight the Fortress Gatekeepers together. Alas, the Centurian
  doesn't have the endurance that Pit does, but he is still useful.
- Get the Check Sheet and purchase the Pencil and Flaming Torch at the Store
  if you want a map of your own in the game.
- Go to the Hospital if you get turned into an eggplant.
- Use the Hot Springs to refill your endurance.
- The maps provided below don't tell you how certain rooms are divided, so 
  you'll still have to explore a little bit (hey, you have to do SOME work and
  you should build up your collection of hearts along the way). Visit all the 
  rooms.
- The (N)est of Monsters' rooms are good for getting hearts, points, etc.
- There is NO Black Market (so you can't buy on credit) in the fortresses; 
  only Stores. Getting hearts shouldn't be a problem, though. Defeat as many 
  enemies as possible. You can revisit the stores, so work your way around the
  fortresses a few times for extra points and hearts to purchase all you can.
- Don't enter the Gatekeeper's room until you are ready to fight.

*Endurance & Strength Levels*

Pit starts off pretty weak, but if you acquire enough points, you'll be able
to boost your endurance meter at the checkpoints. The following is a list of 
the approximate point totals needed to earn more endurance:

204,200 points - 5 Endurance Bars
122,300 points - 4 Endurance Bars
 56,600 points - 3 Endurance Bars
 28,200 points - 2 Endurance Bars

If Pit has defeated enough enemies, he can acquire extra arrows (Strength) 
from a friendly god in the Sacred Chamber. To acquire more strength, Pit must:
1) kill lots of enemies, 2) enter all chambers and defeat all the enemies 
there, 3) acquire lots of items, and 4) receive as little damage as possible 
from enemies. These all decide strength bonuses. Don't expect your 4th or 5th
Arrow until you have completed the game once. Although points aren't really 
used in tallying strength bonuses, the following is a rough list of the point 
totals associated with higher strength levels:

798,900 points - 5 Strength (Sacred Arrow/Light Blue)
227,700 points - 4 Strength (Gold Arrow/Pink)
167,000 points - 3 Strength (Silver Arrow/Blue)	
 18,800 points - 2 Strength (Bronze Arrow/Yellow)

Underworld
*Stage 1-1*

On the fourth level up you'll find the Sacred Chamber. However, it won't be 
of much use to you at the beginning of the game. Sometimes arrows providing 
increased fighting power (Strength) will be given to you here by a friendly 
god after battling many enemies.

On the ledges above you'll find a harp that will transform all enemies 
into mallets. Collect the mallets quickly before the effect wears off (you'll 
need them later), and move on. You'll find collecting the mallets will be more
convenient than buying them in a store.

When the path splits, choose the right-hand side. This will lead you to the
Enemy's Lair, where you will be able to acquire a lot of experience. Collect 
as many hearts as possible here by defeating Specknose. Sometimes Pit won't 
be allowed to leave until all the enemies have been defeated.

When you encounter the Reaper further up, a chalice will be just above him.
You'll want to kill him, grab the chalice and enter the (Black) Treasure Room.
If you enter the chamber first, the chalice will be gone when you re-emerge.
Watch your jumps for the rest of the level, and you'll soon come to the end.

*Stage 1-2*

You'll find the Enemy's Lair a few levels above the entrance. Take care 
navigating the icy platforms. Grab the chalice before you enter. The Black 
Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450) is the next chamber you'll come 
across.

Just above the Black Market, a Reaper is guarding another Enemy Lair. Don't 
forget the chalice above him. A few levels up is a Store (Chalice 210; Mallet
20; Feather 390 OR Bottle 350; Mallet 20; Feather 390). Further up, after 
you've encountered those pesky Commyloose creatures, you'll come to the 
Sacred Chamber. Just above is the exit to the level.

*Stage 1-3*

The first chamber is the Enemy's Lair. A short climb up is the Store (Chalice
210; Bottle 350; Feather 390 OR Chalice 210; Mallet 20; Feather 390). You'll 
then come to a split in the path. The right-hand side has more enemies (and 
experience), but the left-hand side has poisonous bushes hanging on the walls.
You can take either path to get to a (Black) Treasure Room.

After a few waves of Commyloose, there will be a harp waiting for you. Soon 
you will be making your way around several logs and come to the Black Market 
(Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450).

A Reaper is guarding the Sacred Training Chamber. Inside you should stand on
the door (be careful not to accidentally jump out the door) and shoot up and 
left at the attacking Monoliths OR stand on the lowest platform while walking 
back and forth while shooting up the entire time (you'll have to do this in
subsequent visits to the STC when the chamber door is blocked off). Eventually
the god will reward you with a new weapon. You may choose either the Sacred 
Bow (your arrows travel faster and further), Fire (your arrows will be set 
aflame and will hit the enemy on target more often) or the Protective Crystal 
(two crystals revolve around Pit's body and protect him from the enemy's 
attacks). It's a tough call; all the weapons are helpful. I went with the 
Sacred Bow and wasn't disappointed. You can always acquire the weapons you 
left behind in later levels. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use your new 
weapon until you can refill your energy in Stage 2-1 (and you can never use 
these weapons in the fortresses). Of course, after you have all the weapons
you don't have to endure any more training, but it is good for building up 
hearts and points.

                            | |-|G|     1 - Entrance

*Gatekeeper Strategy - Twinbellows (100)*

Your energy should be relatively full when you face the boss. If not, visit
the Hot Springs before you enter the Gatekeeper's Room. Also have a Bottle of
Life on hand. You can get a maximum of 28 Centurians, so try to get as many
as possible to make the battle a little easier. You should avoid getting hit 
by jumping when he is firing projectiles at you. Hit Twinbellows with rapid 
fire shots when he pauses. Try to get around him and attack him from behind. 
He can take a lot of damage when retreating to the right side of the room.

***

Overworld
*Stage 2-1*

You will find a harp not far from the entrance. Next to the harp is a Store 
(Bottle 350; Mallet 20; Feather 390 OR Chalice 210; Bottle 350; Feather 390). 
In this level you will get a chance to soak in the relaxing Hot Springs and 
fill up all your energy. Don't pass this chamber by. Farther down the path 
you'll need the endurance to face Specknose in the Enemy's Lair. Next up is 
the Black Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450).

Down the path you'll discover you can take either the high route or the low 
route. Take the high route to get to a (Blue) Treasure Room. Although you may 
be tempted by the chalice and extra enemies to drop down to the lower path, 
you should continue on the high path to get to the Sacred Chamber (unless of 
course you already have 3 Arrows in the 1st Quest or 5 Arrows in the 2nd).

Another Store (Chalice 210; Mallet 20; Feather 390 OR Chalice 210; Bottle 350;
Feather 390) awaits you. After climbing some stone steps, you'll come to the 
Sacred Training Chamber. A short distance away is another Sacred Chamber 
(doesn't it seem odd to have two in the same level?)

*Stage 2-2*

When you start the level, you'll be staring at a door. Enter the (Blue)
Treasure Chamber to beef up your inventory. There are so many chambers in this
stage that you'll think you died and went to Angel Land. After the Treasure
Chamber is the Enemy's Lair. Two in fact. Then the Sacred Chamber.

Finally some enemies make an appearance. The path will split shortly and the
Hot Springs is sitting on the upper path. After evading some Minos, you'll
have your first encounter with the very annoying Pluton. He'll steal one of
your weapons if he touches you. You can buy them back in the Black Market,
but the merchant tends to set very high prices. You can also re-acquire them 
in the Sacred Training Chambers. It's best to avoid Pluton by waiting until he
is close and jumping over him (don't forget he is invincible). You may want to
start the level over if a lot of your possessions are stolen and you are low 
on hearts.

Duck into the Enemy's Lair. After facing some Snowmen you'll come to the Black
Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450). And after jumping from platform 
to platform, you'll find another Enemy's Lair nestled away in the frosty 
mountains nearby. More platforms and Snowmen await you before coming to the
second Black Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450). Not far away is the
exit.

*Stage 2-3*

A few minutes into your evening stroll is a (Black) Treasure Chamber. For some
unknown reason, this chamber acts like a *BLUE* Treasure Chamber; so treat it 
as such if you are using the Treasure Room Cheat (described in the General
Strategy and Tips section).

The Sacred Training Chamber should be your next visit. Soon the path will
split again, but the Store (Bottle 350; Mallet 20; Feather 390 OR Chalice 210;
Bottle 350; Feather 390) is accessible either way. The high path is safer, but
you can gain more experience by taking the low route.

A Snowman will be guarding the entrance to the Enemy's Lair. After passing
some gravestones and Plutons, there will be a Black Market (Bottle 480; Barrel
500; Feather 450). After that, keep going until you reach the exit.

*Gatekeeper Strategy - Hewdraw (200)*

Make sure your energy is full before you fight him (jump in the hot springs
and avoid enemy encounters, not to mention eggplants). He's a little easier 
than Twinbellows, but has twice the hit points. You can get a maximum of 32
Centurians. Study the pattern and attack his head. Stay out of the lava and 
move out of the way when he approaches so you can safely attack him. A horn 
blows whenever you injure him. Keep attacking and you'll win.

***

Skyworld
*Stage 3-1*

Your first visit should be the Hot Springs right by the entrance. You will 
eventually come to a Sacred Chamber after climbing through the clouds. Up 
and to the right of it is the end of the level.

*Stage 3-2*

You'll soon come to the Sacred Training Chamber, and then a Store (Bottle 350;
Mallet 20; Feather 390). The Black Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 
450) should be your next visit. Hike up a little more and the Hot Springs 
waiting for you. Refill your endurance before you leave the stage.

*Stage 3-3*

Not far up is a harp. The Black Market (Bottle 480; Barrel 500; Feather 450)
awaits you. The last chamber before the fortress is the Store (Chalice 210; 
Mallet 20; Feather 390 OR Bottle 350; Mallet 20; Feather 390 OR Chalice 210; 
Bottle 350; Feather 390).

*Gatekeeper Strategy - Pandora (200)*

The battle isn't that difficult, but it is drawn out. Try to get as many of
your (18) Centurian friends as you can, because you won't be needing the 
mallets after this stage. Also stock up on anything you need in the last shop 
before the boss. You won't be needing hearts anymore, either. (At least not 
until Medusa is defeated...) Keep an eye on Pandora so you can avoid him when 
he turns invisible. Likewise, avoid all contact with the bubbles. Aim for the
tip on his head and keep shooting; he'll eventually perish.

***

Palace in the Sky
*Stage 4-1*

You finally made it to the last stage. You need to master some new skills
(like flying), but it shouldn't be too difficult. Stay in the middle of the 
left side of the screen so you can see what's coming up; thus avoiding enemy
contact. Your Light Arrows are very potent and can kill more than one 
enemy at a time (if they are in a horizontal line).

*Gatekeeper Strategy - Medusa (150)*

When fighting Medusa, stay on the left side of the screen and just above eye
level. Medusa's shots should go right by you. Keep facing to the right so
Medusa's beams can't hurt you. When the Snake slithers by, drop down so you
can shoot Medusa's pupil, skewer it, then continue to descend. When the snake
goes by again, rise, blast the monster's pupil again, and continue to ascend. 
Keep in mind that the top left area is a peripheral safe spot. As long as you 
are facing right, you can't be harmed by Medusa or Tanatos. Continue this 
pattern over and over until the creature is "stone dead." There are many 
variations that work well. Experiment with different strategies and use the
one that works for you.

*Unsolved Mysteries*

This FAQ is a work in progress. If you know anything about the stuff in this
section, please email me at <poppmj@cadvision.com>.

- On the Kid Icarus box it says, "Two Player Alternating Game." Although I
doubt it is possible to play Kid Icarus with 2 players, maybe some early
prototype was originally designed for 2 players? Or perhaps this was used to
tip off players on how to lower prices?

- Some sites and magazines mention something about a "Secret Continue" that 
you can access by pressing "B, A, B," when you die. Although it doesn't work, 
I can't imagine why anyone would need this, since the game just continues 
automatically from the stage you perished on. Why hasn't this "tip" been 
disproved?

- There are 3 different endings, but the text at the end is always the same.
It's very ambiguous; leading me to believe there should be another (decisive)
ending. Is there a hidden finale of some sort?
