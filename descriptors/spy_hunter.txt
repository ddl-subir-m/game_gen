Spy Hunter was released in 1983, the same year as Return of the Jedi, Michael
Jackson's "Beat It," leg warmers, pastel suits, and great cars. Thirty-four 
years later it's still a hell of a game. I grew up playing it, and for the 
dozen people that read this, thank you.

- Get used to high gear! You'll need it to enter weapons vans and outrun
  enemies. It is one of your most valuable defenses besides your weapons.
- Use high gear in VERY short bursts!!!
- You can alternatively just drive in high gear the whole time, pressing the
  accelerator halfway so your car stays in the middle of the screen, pushing
  down to outrun enemies as needed. Just be very careful of when you have to 
  slow down. This is the best way to play the boat stages.
- Slowing down is also dangerous. If you get rear-ended while near the bottom
  of the screen (that is, when nearly stopped), you'll explode. Plus, the 
  ol' slow-down-to-get-behind-them trick doesn't work that well.
- Oil slick is hands down the best special weapon. Use it in small taps rather
  than holding the button down. Conservation is key!
- You can call one additional weapons van per zone, so be sure to call one at
  the very end to replenish your ammo.
- You can also intentionally keep weapons vans in front of you (without
  entering them) so you can restock and/or be taken out of danger at the exact	
  right moment.
- Weapons vans drop you off at the bottom of the screen. Drive alongside the 
  road for a moment (till you're in the middle of the screen) and pull out
  when you see it's safe. Otherwise, you might get rear-ended and explode.
- You get one bonus car for making 10,000 points while the timer is running.
  And you can get one more if you make 18,000!
- You can utilize the invincibility glitch (see Glitches section) to avoid
  tricky areas like icy roads.

A. CONTROLS  
         
Spy Hunter has two versions-- a stand-up cabinet and a sit-down. On both,
there is an accelerator pedal on the floor, a gear shifter, and an airplane
yoke with buttons and triggers to steer your car/use its weapons. 

The "dashboard" of your car below the monitor has lights to indicate when a
weapons van is available, as well as lights indicating what weapons are
available to use.          
           
                                 
WEAPONS VAN (CENTER)   -  Starts the game. Calls a weapons van when in an
                          appropriate zone. Flashes when you first enter a
                          weapons van zone and stays on to indicate you can
                          call another one.

LEFT TRIGGER (REAR)    -  Fires missiles when available.

RIGHT TRIGGER (REAR)   -  Fires front-facing machine guns. Exits game
                          instructions.

LEFT BUTTON (TOP)      -  Releases oil slick when available.

RIGHT BUTTON (TOP)     -  Releases smokescreen when available.

ACCELERATOR PEDAL      -  Opens game instructions once a coin is inserted.
                          Also accelerates your car, whoa!

GEAR SHIFTER           -  Shifts between low and high gear.

                                                                        [004B]
B. OBJECTIVE

In Spy Hunter, you take the role of an unnamed spy behind the wheel of the
G-6155 Interceptor, a state-of-the-art supercar outfitted with twin front
machine guns, and also equipped with oil slick nozzles, smokescreen vents, and
heat-seeking surface-to-air missile turrets. You are being relentlessly chased
by the mysterious "M" organization, who'll throw everything at you from
bulletproof trucks to bomb-dropping helicopters. They won't stop until you're
dead, and neither will you-- it's a slow battle of attrition to the very end.

Spy Hunter is a game of survival. There is no end; your enemies will hunt you
down to the ends of the earth. It's up to you to incovenience/outrun them for
as long as possible, to be an inspiration to all spies everywhere!

[LIVES]
When the game starts, there will be a timer at the top of the screen that
counts down from 999. During this time, you have infinite lives. Once the
timer runs out, you will have a finite number of lives. If you do not
reach 10,000 points by the time the timer runs out, then you will have no 
extra lives besides your current car. If you reach 10,000 points before the
timer runs out, you will get one bonus life. If you reach 18,000 you'll have
two bonus lives. At 30,000, you'll get another bonus car. From there on 
out, you will be awarded one bonus car at 30,000; 60,000; 90,000; and
120,000 points.


[GAME OVER]
The game ends when you've lost all your lives. You can die by:
- Being rammed off, or veering into, the side of the road/water.
- Colliding with a vehicle as it's exploding (only after the timer ends) while
  travelling at full speed in either low or high gear.
- Colliding with a vehicle while in high gear.
- Getting your tires blown out by a Switchblade.
- Getting your tire shot out by an Enforcer.
- Running over a crater created by a Mad Bomber or being directly hit by them.
- Hitting a barrel dropped by a Barrel Dumper.
- Getting hit by a Dr. Torpedo.
- Getting rear-ended when near the bottom of the screen. This can happen when
  you're significantly slowed down, stopped, or if you get dropped off by a 
  weapons van and immediately pull out to the main road.

==============================================================================



==============================================================================

                                                                        [004C]
B. SCORING AND BONUS CARS

Your score is constantly counting up as long as your car is moving, so think
of it as an odometer of sorts. You also get additional points for each enemy
destroyed, or your score may temporarily stop accruing when destroying an
ally.

[SCORING]
ROADS: 15 points/screen
WATER: 25 points/screen
+ 150 points per Switchblade destroyed
+ 150 points per Road Lord destroyed
+ 500 points per Enforcer destroyed
+ 700 points per Mad Bomber destroyed
+ 150 points per Barrel Dumper destroyed
+ 500 points per Dr. Torpedo destroyed

*Note: A screen is the minimum distance your car can move at any given speed.


[PENALTIES]
1 second pause/civilian destroyed (approx. 150 points withheld)
2 second pause/weapons van destroyed (approx. 300 points withheld)
3 second pause/tugboat destroyed (approx. 450 points withheld)
In addition to this, you will not be able to call a second weapons van if in
a weapons van zone.

*Note: During this pause, you will not gain points for any enemies destroyed.


[BONUS CARS]
10,000 (if and only if reached before timer runs out)
18,000 (if and only if reached before timer runs out)
30,000
60,000
90,000
120,000

Caps at 6 bonus cars. You do not get any bonus lives from 120,000 and onward.

==============================================================================

                                                                        [004D]
C. STAGES

[NORMAL ROADS]
EFFECTS: None.
APPEARANCE: Temperate/desert roadscape
WARNING: None.
ENCOUNTER: All land-based enemies, civilians, weapons vans


[ICY ROADS]
EFFECTS: Significantly more sluggish handling
APPEARANCE: Blue-tinted road
WARNING: "Icy roads ahead" in middle of screen
ENCOUNTER: All land-based enemies, civilians, weapons vans

Once the timer runs out, you'll start potentially encountering icy roads. You
cannot avoid them; they randomly appear and you cannot take an alternate turn,
etc. to bypass them. You will hear a warning tone and the message "Icy roads
ahead" will appear in the middle of your screen.

Handling is a lot less responsive and of course, the road is a lot more
slippery. Ramming vehicles off the road is absolutely NOT recommended. Even
just swerving out of the way of burning cars can be dangerous. Ignore enemies
as much as you can and just focus on getting out alive. Icy roads last for an
entire weapons van zone and ends after the next fork.

Note: if you enter a water stage from icy roads, you will be back on icy roads
again once returning to land. As usual, they will end after the next fork.


[WATER]
EFFECTS: Your car turns into a boat. Islands in the middle are potential
hazards. Weapons vans (or rather, boats) do not appear.
APPEARANCE: Like water
WARNING: "Bridge out ahead, use detour on left" in middle of screen OR there
is a narrow road that diverges to left, usually after very curvy roads
ENCOUNTER: All water-based enemies (including Mad Bombers)

Once the timer runs out, you may also encounter water stages. They are at
first optional, where you can voluntarily take a narrow detour road on the
left:

\    \.  .|              |
 \    \. .|       / \    |
  \    \. |        |     |
   \    \.|        |     |
    \    \|              |
     \         TO MAIN   |
     |            ROAD   |
     |     __            |    
     |    /\             |     
     |      \            |     
     |       \           |     
     |                   |     
     |  TO BOATHOUSE     |     
     |                   |       

Other times, water stages are unavoidable. You will hear a warning tone and 
the message "Bridge out ahead, use detour on left" will appear in the middle
of your screen. If you continue straight, the bridge will indeed be out and
you will careen to your death. You will, however, respawn on the other side 
of the bridge and bypass the water stage.

On water, you will have to deal with Barrel Dumpers, Doctor Torpedoes, and Mad
Bombers. These enemies can be dealt with with all conventional weapons, and
enemy boats can also be rammed into the embankment on the sides of the screen. 
There will also be islands of sand in the middle of the water, which your 
boat can jump over if you're going at speed (that is, top speed in low gear in
or in high gear in the middle/top of the screen). If any slower, your boat may
run aground and explode. 

There is no such thing as weapons boats, only tugboats to respawn you when
you die. In order to exit a water stage, keep to the right. You will
eventually be able to take a narrow access road on the right: 

     |          | .  .   /    /
     |   / \    |.  ..  /    /
     |    |     | .    /    /
     |    |     | .   /    /
     |          |___./    /
     | CONTINUE          /
     | WATER STAGE       |
     |                   |    
     |                   |     
     |          __       |     
     |           /\      |     
     |          /        |     
     |                   |     
     |  TO WEAPONS VAN   |       

There is no overtly obvious change of scenery to indicate an exit is coming
up, but the water and access road will be separated by a huge shoal. The 
access road will take you to a van that gives you a special weapon and drops
you back off on the road.

Hailing from weaponized cars the likes of James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 and
Maxwell Smart's Sunbeam Tiger Mark I, the G-6155 Interceptor is fast, deadly,
and damned stylish. It is a fictional car, but was based on the real-world 
Isdera Imperator 108i (itself based on a Mercedes Benz concept car from the 
1980s), only 30 of which were ever produced.


                                                                        [005A]
A. LOW AND HIGH GEAR

FUNCTION: Accelerates your car to dangerous speeds.
WEAPONS VAN SYMBOL: N/A
AMMO: N/A
GOOD FOR: All situations

Despite supposedly being a state-of-the-art superspy supercar, every enemy in
the game can catch up to and outrun you. And in fact, your car can't even
catch up to weapons vans without shifting into high gear.

High gear allows your car to go from the middle of the screen to the top 1/4
of the screen at max speed, allowing you to go fast enough to outrun enemies
and enter weapons vans. However, your car will explode should you collide with
any other vehicle (which doesn't happen during your normal "low" gear). This
dangerous speed is indicated by small flames shooting from the back of your 
tires.

USE HIGH GEAR IN VERY SHORT BURSTS!!! Either that, or drive in high gear the
entire time, pressing your accelerator down only partway to stay in the middle
of the screen and letting off/downshifting as needed. Put the pedal to the 
floor to accelerate enough to overtake civilians and/or outrun enemies. Just
be careful not to hit anyone or anything at high speed. 

You will have to upshift to avoid Switchblades if you do not have oil slick
or smokescreen. You can also upshift to avoid Road Lords and Enforcers if
you'd prefer not to try fighting them. If they are off your screen for long 
enough (more than a few seconds), they'll "disappear." If not, they will 
eventually catch up to you from off-screen again, because they're just as good
at giving chase as you are at running away. Also upshift to help better avoid
Mad Bomber bombs.

If you want the two bonus cars instead of one by reaching 18,000 before the
timer, you will have to be speeding at every available moment. AGAIN, DO THIS
IN VERY SHORT BURSTS!

When on water, the exact same principles apply. Upshift to avoid Barrel
Dumpers, and upshift to keep your distance from Dr. Torpedoes.

***IMPORTANT***: If your car is going slow enough, or from a standstill, you
must shift back to low gear in order to move. It's like your car stalling 
out-- you can't launch in 5th!

==============================================================================



==============================================================================

                                                                        [005B]
B. MACHINE GUNS

FUNCTION: Twin front-facing machine guns
AMMO: Infinite
WEAPONS VAN SYMBOL: N/A
GOOD FOR: All situations (except against Road Lords)

Technically your car's only front-facing weapon, machine guns can destroy any
vehicle on the road (or boat in the water) excepting Road Lords. There's no
more satisfying feeling than gunning down a Switchblade or Barrel Dumper. 
However, the machine gun should be used a little more incidentally than you 
would think. That is, machine gun an enemy if you happen to find one in front 
of you, but don't try to create opportunities to use it like slowing down to 
get behind enemies. Also fire in very small bursts-- two bullets is enough,
and immediately sweve out of the way of the wreckage.

Enemies are smart enough that if you try to slow down to get behind them,
they'll slow down too until you're both pretty much stopped. You can shoot
them here, but the problem is, if you get rear-ended while your car/boat is 
moving at very slow speed or stopped (i.e. near the bottom of the screen), 
you'll explode. It's not worth risking losing a life for a few extra points. 

==============================================================================



==============================================================================

                                                                        [005C]
C. OIL SLICK

FUNCTION: Lays oil slick behind you, causing cars to run off the road and
vaporizing boats.
AMMO: 3 seconds of continuous use (can also be used in small bursts)
WEAPONS VAN SYMBOL: Two black oil drums
GOOD FOR: All situations

Oil slick is a godsend, your #1 counter to Switchblades and any other car/boat
that can threaten you. Use it in small bursts in order to maximize the ammo 
you're given. Use the smallest tap possible; you don't need to lay down a long
trail to get rid of enemies. This technique will give you a few dozen uses. 
You may also need to shift into high gear/accelerate to get ahead of enemies 
and lay down your oil.

Once a target car touches your oil slick, it will wobble side to side and 
eventually run off the road and explode. They stop being a threat the moment
they get slicked. When on water, you leave a flaming trail of oil behind you
that instantly vaporizes boats. Badass.

==============================================================================



==============================================================================

                                                                        [005D]
D. SMOKESCREEN

FUNCTION: Releases a thick cloud of smoke behind you, enveloping chasing cars
or boats.
AMMO: 3 uses
WEAPONS VAN SYMBOL: Grey popcorn (yes, I know it's a smoke cloud)
GOOD FOR: Icy roads, water, curvy roads

Smokescreen covers the road for three seconds, of which you get three uses.
Since it covers almost the entire road behind you, you don't need to position
your car directly in front of an enemy to use it effectively (unlike oil
slick). It's best for icy roads, curvy roads, or water, where excessive 
maneuvering can be dangerous. Since you get so few uses compared to oil slick,
however, it is best saved for true emergencies.

Smokescreen does not have friendly fire-- if you use it on a Switchblade and
civilian at the same time, for example, they'll both disappear but you will
not get penalized. 

==============================================================================



==============================================================================

                                                                        [005E]
E. HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES

FUNCTION: Locks on to and destroys Mad Bombers.
AMMO: 3 uses
WEAPONS VAN SYMBOL: A pink-and-white missile
GOOD FOR: Mad Bombers only

Heat-seeking missiles are your only weapon against Mad Bombers, and work only
against Mad Bombers-- you cannot destroy anything on the ground with them.
They don't have to be aimed, either! Fire when they are close to you for
maximum chances of a hit. Basically, the closer Mad Bombers are to your car
when the missile is fired, the higher chance of a hit. The farther away, the
lower the chance. When they are near the top or bottom edge of the screen, it
is pretty much a guaranteed miss.

If a hit, missiles will appear to explode directly under the Mad Bomber's
rotors. If a miss, it will explode just outside of their rotors. There will
be a small delay following a hit, after which the Mad Bomber will spin and 
explode (in the sky). Missiles are fairly accurate, and will hit 85% of the 
time.

A. CIVILIANS

APPEARANCE: Motorcycles, pink 1950s sedans, or baby blue VW Beetles
TAGLINE: N/A
SPECIAL ABILITIES: N/A
OCCURRENCE: Common; none on water.
POINT VALUE: 1 second penalty (approx. 150 points withheld); you will not be
able to call a second weapons van if in a weapons van zone

Don't crash into with motorcycles (they'll lose control and explode) and don't
crash into/machine gun pink cars and Beetles. For some reason, enemies will 
try to avoid civilians.

B. WEAPONS VANS

APPEARANCE: Pink trucks with a brown trailer (yes, they're trucks even though
they're called vans)
TAGLINE: N/A
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Grants special weapons, immune to enemies
OCCURRENCE: Certain zones, after forks in road
POINT VALUE: 2 second penalty (approx. 300 points withheld); you will not be
able to call a second weapons van if in a weapons van zone

At certain points in the road, usually after a fork, the weapons van light
will flash to indicate you've entered a weapons van zone. A van will catch up
from behind you and let its ramps down. Upshift to enter. The weapon they
give you is indicated by the symbol on their roof. They'll drop you off on the
side of the road, and now you have said weapon. You will be able to call one
more van by pressing the weapons van button, which is now lit instead of
flashing. You will not be able to call another one if you kill a civilian or
weapons van.

Weapons van zones appear directly after you reach a fork in the road and take
either left or right. The road will now fill the entire screen; this is the 
beginning of the zone. The road will then narrow/curve and transition into a
new area, usually a bridge over water or the road straightening out again (but
no longer filling the screen); this part is the middle of the zone. You will
then reach another fork in the road-- this is the very end of the zone. A new
weapons van zone (usually with a different weapon) begins after this fork. The
roadscape will also change (e.g. from temperate to desert or some other 
palette change) to indicate this.

If you destroy a weapons van or civilian, you can no longer call them in that 
particular zone, so be careful! Maximize their usefulness by calling one at
the beginning of the zone and one at the very end to replenish ammo. You can 
also deliberately keep one in front of you (without entering) so you can 
replenish and be taken off the road at the exact right moment.

Curiously, weapons vans are immune to enemy weapons. If you ram a Switchblade
into a weapons van, their blades will disappear on the side that hit the van.
You can kind of use this to help you more safely ram Switchblades off the road.
Similarly, Enforcers can't destroy weapons vans. Mad Bomber bombs can't kill
vans either. Not that this is a particular concern-- enemies only care about
killing you and ignore all other friendly units.

Also, beware: weapons vans drop you off at the bottom of the screen. If you
immediately pull out to the side, you risk getting rear-ended and exploding.
Drive on the side until you can pull out in the middle of the screen/when it's
safe. If you get rear-ended in the middle of the screen, you won't explode.

Weapons vans are also how you respawn. When you die, a weapons van comes and
drops off a new car on the side of the road. You cannot re-enter this van and
it cannot give you weapons.

C. TUGBOATS

APPEARANCE: Red boat with smokestack
TAGLINE: N/A
SPECIAL ABILITIES: None.
OCCURRENCE: Drops you off after dying on the water.
POINT VALUE: 3 second penalty (approx. 450 points withheld)

Tugboats drop off a new boat when you die on the water. You cannot enter these
and they serve no other function. There are no such thing as weapons boats.

D. SWITCHBLADES

APPEARANCE: Dark blue 1957 Chevy Bel-Air with an M on roof
TAGLINE: "Never to be trusted"
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Blades on both sides that can spin you off the road,
can destroy other enemies/civilians on accident
OCCURRENCE: Common
POINT VALUE: 150

The most common enemy is also the most deadly. One touch is all it takes to
spin you off the road. Switchblades are best dealt with oil slick, 
smokescreen, or outran by shifting into high gear. Remember, use high gear in
short bursts! They can catch up to you after a bit, but keep upshifting and
you'll eventually lose them.

You can actually ram Switchblades off the road by carefully tapping them on
the corners of their fenders, right above their blade. This is usually more
effort than it's worth, but it's an option if you ever need to. You can also 
do this to nudge them into other cars and destroy them, such as Road Lords or
Enforcers. This also de-blades them on one side. Weapons vans cannot be
destroyed by Switchblades. As far as I know, you do not get any points for
doing this.

E. ROAD LORDS

APPEARANCE: Purple rectangular SUV/trucks
TAGLINE: "Bulletproof bullies"
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Cannot be destroyed by machine guns
OCCURRENCE: Common
POINT VALUE: 150

Road Lords' only weapon against you is the ability to ram you off the road.
They're even smart enough to fake you out, such as slowing down and forcing
you to miss when trying to ram them. They're most dangerous on narrow and 
curvy roads, but depending on your playstyle you can choose to either outrun
them or duke it out. As always, they can also be dispatched with oil slick or
smokescreen.

F. ENFORCERS

APPEARANCE: Dark blue limousines with an M on the roof
TAGLINE: "Double barrel action"
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Has a sniper-passenger that can shoot your tire out
OCCURRENCE: Rare
POINT VALUE: 500

Enforcers have to line up with one of your tires in order to successfully 
shoot them out and send you spinning off the road. If they miss and hit you
anywhere else, you're okay. Do NOT let them stay alongside you for too long,
letting them line up the perfect shot, and absolutely do NOT slow down as that
will guarantee a hit. They are a little easier to ram off the road than Road
Lords owing to their length, and doing this prevents the guy from popping out
the window, but only for a split second. It's best to avoid them by upshifting
and oil slicking/smokescreening, ramming only when you don't have any other 
special weapons.

Enforcers are usually parked on the side of the road, take their first shot
at you when you pass by, and then start chasing you. This first shot won't hit
you unless you are going slowly (i.e. below top speed in low gear). They may 
also appear from behind like normal enemies.

G. MAD BOMBERS

APPEARANCE: Light blue helicopters
TAGLINE: "Masters of the sky"
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Drops bombs that make craters, can also kill enemies/
civilians
OCCURRENCE: Uncommon
POINT VALUE: 700

You'll hear chopper blades as a warning that a Mad Bomber is about to appear.
Mad Bombers drop bombs all over the road, which whistle as they come down.
They can kill you with a direct hit. Any misses will make craters in the road/
disruptions in the water, which will kill anything that runs over them 
(including enemies). There is a delay between when the bombs are dropped and
when they actually hit the ground, giving you some time to react. Stay to the
sides of the road/water to draw their bombs to the sides of the screen; that
way, the middle of the screen stays clear, and you have a lot more room to 
maneuver around everything else. 

Mad Bomber bombs affect everyone, so it's the only enemy that deals a
significant amount of friendly fire. As far as I know, enemies destroyed by 
Mad Bombers do not add to your score.

Mad Bombers are the only enemy in the game that missiles are effective 
against. Conveniently, in the beginning of the game, they spawn only in zones
where you're also given missiles. Sooner or later, they'll start spawning 
regardless of what weapons you're given, so your only choice is to outrun 
them.

Remember, the best time to fire missiles is when they are close to your car
(i.e. when they're in the middle of the screen).

Mad Bombers are also the only enemy that can attack you on both land and
water. Follow the same protocol for water.

H. BARREL DUMPERS

APPEARANCE: Small black and teal speedboats
TAGLINE: N/A
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Drops explosive barrels behind them; attacks you from in
front
OCCURRENCE: Common
POINT VALUE: 150

Barrel Dumpers can appear from either the bottom of the screen or the top of
the screen. They attack by dumping explosive barrels behind them, which kill
you if you run into them. You'll really have to play with your accelerator
here, so you can slow down to avoid barrels but speed up incrementally so you
can machine gun them from as far as humanly possible. Also, avoid ever being
in the same column as them. Swerve in to machine gun, and swerve the hell out
of the way. They may also try to ram you into the embankment if they come from
behind, so beware of that as well. 

Boats are slightly easier to ram off the water, due to the fact that ramming
them into the shoulder is sufficient to make them explode. Compare this to 
ramming vehicles off the road, where you actually have to ram them all the way
off into the bushes.

J. DR. TORPEDOES

APPEARANCE: Wide blue two-man boats
TAGLINE: N/A
SPECIAL ABILITIES: Fires torpedoes forwards AND backwards
OCCURRENCE: Rare
POINT VALUE: 500

Once you're on the water for long enough, Doctor Torpedo starts making his
(or, well, their) appearance. They can fire their slow-moving torpedoes both
forwards and backwards. It's a similar principle to barrels, except torpedoes
will move down the entire column of water. NEVER, EVER, EVER be in the same 
column as them. Finely play with your speed, try your best to machine gun them
in between torpedoes from as far as possible, and swerve the hell out of the 
way when they appear to let them pass. Even better if you can just oil slick/
smokescreen them to oblivion.
