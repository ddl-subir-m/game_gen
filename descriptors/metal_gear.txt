I will only put symbols around new equipment/locations/weapons/ammo. If I

***NOTE***
Due to the fact that the story in this game ridiculous, has little bearing 
on the Metal Gear series, and since it Hideo Kojima refuses to acknowledge 
this version of the game as an official part of the Metal Gear series, I will 
alter some parts of it to more closely follow that of Metal Gear for MSX, 
the TRUE first installment of the Metal Gear series. Also note that I modified 
this guide from the MSX version to the Commodore 64 version. I had to redo 
most of this guide and it got a little messy in some parts so please e-mail 
me if you find any major errors in it. 

I. Solid Snake's Entrance:
You (Solid Snake) start off by landing in the +++JUNGLE+++ outside of Outer 
Heaven. Snake receives a call from the commander-in-chief of FOX-HOUND, Big 
Boss. He tells you that your mission is to infiltrate the terrorist fortress 
Outer Heaven and destroy the ultimate weapon, Metal Gear. He will tell you 
that your first objective is to search for the missing FOX-HOUND operative 
Grey Fox and search for Metal Gear. He will tell you that if you need any 
help to contact him at transceiver frequency 120.85. Make a note of that and 
end the transmission. When you start the game, head to your right. Knock out 
the guard beside the truck and head south. On this screen you will see three 
dogs. Run down the center of the screen and take the right path down and onto 
the next screen. Run past the dog here as well. You might have taken some 
damage from the dogs, but don't worry, you'll get it back soon enough. Run 
up next to the guard here and quickly punch him. Inside the truck you will 
get ---BINOCULARS---. Prepare to quickly run down as soon as you exit the 
truck and onto the next screen. You will see two guards here. Wait until each 
of them turns away from you and punch them out. Continue south. Punch the 
sleeping dog and head south again. Pick a guard, punch him out, and head down. 
More guards, you know what to do. Enter the top truck to get ---CARD 1---. 
Exit the truck and the guards will immediately come towards you. Take them 
out and enter the lower truck. The truck have started to move. Once the truck 
stops "having" moved, exit it and then enter the truck on the left side of 
the screen. Grab the RATIONS and exit. Enter again if you want more RATIONS. 
Three is the maximum you can get at this time. Once you exit, the guard will 
attack you. Run and enter the truck on the right. Once you get out, enter 
the one right below you. Exit and go down two screens. Enter the top truck 
to get the ===PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE===. Head down to the southern most truck to 
get ---CARD 4---. Exit and enter the middle truck to be transported again. 
Defeat the guards here or run from them and enter the truck on the right. 
Exit the truck and grab RATIONS from the truck on the left if needed. Knock 
out the guard and enter +++BUILDING ONE+++. Now go to the right and up to 
the next screen. Knock out the guard on this screen and use CARD 1 to enter 
the room. The guard will see you when you enter. Run up, kill him, and grab 
the ---GAS MASK--- on the table. Exit the room and punch out the guard in 
front of you in this room. From here, head left along the north wall until 
you get to a screen with three guards and Big Boss calls you. Answer the call 
and he will tell you that your job is to infiltrate and blah, blah, blah. 
In fact, I just wouldn't answer it to spare yourself the trouble of having 
to listen to it. Head north along the right path. When a hole in the ground 
starts to open, go to your transceiver. When you exit the screen, the hole 
will be gone. Head east from here. On this screen you'll find three trucks 
Enter the truck on the left to find the ===HANDGUN===. Don't try to use it 
just yet as you don't have and ==-AMMO-== for it yet. Exit the truck and enter 
the one on the right to grab the ===MINES===. Exit the truck and head back 
to the screen with the elevator. Walk along the top part of the wall and enter 
the elevator using CARD 1. Take the elevator to the third floor. 

Here you'll see two cameras in this room. One on the west wall and one on 
the north side of the square in the middle of the room. Sneak past the cameras 
and head down on the far left wall. Avoid the two guards in this area and 
go in the door on the left. In here you will find some AMMO. Use CARD 1 to 
enter the door on the south wall. In here, you will find a POW tied to a chair. 
Go over to him to release him. Now use CARD 1 to OPEN the door on the east 
wall. Now equip your GAS MASK and enter the room. You will now receive a call 
from Big Boss. He will tell you to put on your GAS MASK in the gas room (I 
guess he's a little late on that one, huh). Make it through the gas room and 
use CARD 1 to enter the passage in the southeast corner of the room. Enter 
the open door. Wait for the rolling pin to go to the right side, and then 
grab the PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES. Make your way back to the entrance then wait 
for it to roll left before heading in the door on the right. Keep going right 
to the next screen. On this screen, two guards will come down from the slots 
on the north part of the room. Take them out by punching and proceed to the 
next screen. Head down immediately in this room, around the boxes, and enter 
the door on the right. Don't worry about the camera on your way in. In here, 
go to the desk and grab ---CARD 2---. Exit the room and use CARD 2 to enter 
the door on the left side of the room. In here you will find RATIONS. Exit 
the room and head back to the room that was right after the gas room. Use 
CARD 2 to enter the door in the northwest corner of the room. In here you 
will find ===REMOTE-CONTROLLED MISSLES===. Exit the room and then use CARD 
1 on the south door to rescue the POW. He will tell you that a fellow 
FOX-HOUNDER infiltrated Outer Heaven days ago and was captured, but he is 
still alive. Head back to the screen with two cameras and two doors (one of 
the doors was where you got CARD 2 at). From here, head up to the next screen. 
Here you will see a flashing white floor and a control box on the other side 
of the room. Big Boss will call you and tell you to use your REMOTE-CONTROLLED 
MISSLES on the power box to turn off the high-voltage. Use your 
REMOTE-CONTROLLED MISSLES to destroy the control box. That will turn off the 
electric floor and allow you to cross it to the next screen.


II. Captured on Purpose:
The first part of the game is now completed. You've also picked up about 25% 
of your weapons up to this point. Well, enough of my talking, it's time to 
move on to the second chapter of the first Metal Gear. 

On this screen there will be two guards and a door on the east wall. Take 
out the guard walking east and use CARD 1 to enter the door. In the room you 
will find the third POW. Rescue him and he will tell you that resistance member 
Diane will help you on frequency 120.33. Make a note of that and exit the 
room. Head north to the next screen. On this screen you will see an elevator 
guarded by two guards. Take them both out and head left. On this screen, you 
will see three guards patrolling the area. As long as you stay lined up with 
the wall, they won't see you. Take out the two guards that approach you by 
punching them. Now you'll want to enter the door on the north side of the 
room. Wait until the guard on the west of the room is moving towards the south 
and use CARD 2 to enter the room. In the room you will find the ---CARDBOARD 
BOX---. Now exit the room. When you come out of the room, there will only 
be two guards on this screen, the guard in the south part of the room and 
the guard in the west part of the room. Run past the guards and use CARD 2 
to enter the door. Go down and enter the door in the middle of the screen. 
Once in this room, you will need to quickly move to the south wall and use 
CARD 2 to enter the room. Grab the ===SILENCER=== in that room. Now that you 
have the SILENCER you may use your gun without the guards hearing it. Use 
CARD 1 to enter the room on the east wall. In here you will find the ===GRENADE 
LAUNCHER===. Exit the room and head back to the elevator guarded by two guards 
from a couple screens ago. Take out the two guards and use CARD 2 to enter 
the elevator. Take the elevator down to the second floor. 

When you exit the elevator, you will see two cameras. One on the north wall, 
one on the right wall. Use the crates to avoid the camera and head down to 
the next screen. On this screen, you will see a sleeping guars. Kill him and 
head south once again. On this screen you will see gray colored walls with 
black lines on them. These are laser traps. Unlike Metal Gear Solid, your 
---CIGARETTES--- won't detect the lasers. Since you currently have nothing 
to get through the laser traps, I'll do my best to give you directions on 
how to avoid the lasers. From the top center of the screen, head down until 
you hit a wall. Then turn right until you hit a wall. Then go down to the 
next screen. This screen it similar to the last, but there is a room you need 
to enter at the top of the screen. From the entrance of the screen, go down. 
As you proceed down, count the number of laser trap walls you see. When you 
reach the second and third ones, go between them. Now go down until you hit 
a wall and then go left until pass three laser walls. Now go up past two laser 
walls. Now you go right until you are standing in front of the door. Use CARD 
1 to enter the room. In here you will find a POW. Rescue him and exit the 
room. Head back through the laser traps until you come to the screen with 
the sleeping guard. Take him out again and head up the left path. Go left 
again on the next screen and you will come to a screen with three guards. 
Watch their walking pattern and take them out one at a time. Then down the 
path on the southwest part of the room. On this screen you will see a security 
camera and two doors. Avoid the camera and head in the door on the right to 
find AMMO. Exit that room and enter the room on the left to find PLASTIC 
EXPLOSIVES. Exit the room and head back to the elevator. Take the elevator 
to the first floor. When you exit the elevator you will see two guards 
patrolling around some crates. Go in between the crates and a pit will start 
to open. Do the same thing you did last time and head south. On this screen 
you will see three cameras. Two on the right wall and one on the left. Use 
the crates to avoid the cameras and use CARD 2 to enter the room on the left. 
In here you will find a POW. Rescue him and he will tell you that a FOX-HOUNDER 
named Grey Fox is confined in a secret cell. Exit the room and head south. 
When you enter the next screen, DON'T MOVE! Two guards will be patrolling 
the area and if you move, the one on the right can see you. Take out the guard 
on the left, then the one on the right when he's not looking. Use CARD 2 to 
enter the door on the right. Inside you will find a ===SUB MACHINE GUN===. 
Exit the room and use CARD 1 to enter the door on the left. Inside you will 
find a POW. He will tell you that the best way to gain access to the secret 
cell is to allow yourself to be captured. Exit the room and head south. On 
this screen, you will see a guard patrolling the area with a truck on the 
left. Take him out, and then enter the truck.  As you proceed through the 
truck, a guard will come behind you and say "DON'T MOVE" and tell you that 
you are captured. The screen will then fade to black as Snake is captured...


III. Rescuing Grey Fox:
After getting captured, it's time for Snake to complete his first objective 
of the game and to gain a new objective in his operation. You will also fight 
the first boss of the game. 

With Snake captured and taken to the secret cell inside of the +++STORAGE 
BUILDING+++, its time to figure out a way to rescue Grey Fox. Big Boss will 
call you and tell you to move out and locate Grey Fox's solitary cell. He 
suggest to you that you punch the walls to get out. End the call and punch 
on middle part of the west wall until you hear a strange tap. Keep punching 
on it to open up a passageway to the next cell. Proceed into the next cell. 
Inside you will find the missing FOX-HOUND operative, Grey Fox. Rescue him 
and he will tell you that Metal Gear is nuclear armed and that you must destroy 
it before it is completed. He says that Dr. Pettrovich Madnar, the designer 
of Metal Gear, is the only one who knows how to destroy it.  Punch on the 
spot just to the left of center on the south wall until you hear a strange 
tap and keep punching that spot until the wall breaks. Exit the solitary cell. 
This is the first floor basement of +++BUILDING TWO+++. You have no equipment 
and no weapons so you must be cautious as you proceed. Head right from here. 
In this room you will be met by the first boss of the game, Shoot Gunner. 

*****BOSS FIGHT #1*****
Shoot Gunner

Ok, you must fight this boss on your own with no weapons. Good luck....


Just kidding:) You didn't think I would make you fight him with no boss 
strategy did you? If you notice in this room you will see two doors on the 
south wall. Hide behind the crates on the right side of the room and call 
Big Boss (120.85). He will tell you that your weapons and equipment must be 
in one of those rooms. Enter the door on the right and you will get your weapons 
and equipment back. Exit that room and use CARD 2 to enter the door on the 
left. Enter the room to find ---CARD 3---. Exit the room and hide back behind 
the crates again. Shoot Gunner will fire a spray of bullets at you as you 
move across the room. When you're behind the crates, equip your 
REMOTE-CONTROLLED MISSLES and fire them at Shoot Gunner. Three or four hits 
with it will kill him. 

After the battle, check your equipment. You will notice that you have a new 
little item called the ---TRANSMITTER---. The TRANSMITTER will alert the 
guards of your presence as long as you have it on you. Press the fire button 
to get rid of it. Use CARD 3 to exit the room via the door on the east side 
of the room. This next area is one big spiral with guard dogs littered around 
it. Kill the dog next to the door and use CARD 2 on the south door. Grab the 
---BODY ARMOR--- and exit the room.  Watch out for dogs on your way out. Follow 
the path right. Use CARD 2 to open the door. Inside the room you will find 
a ---BOMB BLAST SUIT--- on the desk. Take it and go around until you come 
to a wall. Enter that room below you using CARD 3. When you enter the room, 
you will find the ---UNIFORM---. Exit the room and head to the right one 
screen. Use CARD 3 to exit the building. From here go right twice and then 
down twice. Use CARD 4 to enter BUILDING ONE. Go right past the four guards 
to the next screen. Enter the elevator on this screen and take it to the second 
floor. 

On the second floor, use the crates to avoid the camera again and head left. 
You will see the room with the three guards again. Take them out and use CARD 
3 to enter the door on the west wall. Proceed through this room. In the next 
room you will see a rolling pin. Proceed quickly through this room and exit 
the room via the door on the south wall. In the next area you will see a bunch 
of crates and a single guard behind them. Just easily avoid the guard and 
head south. In this room you will see a large wall in the middle of the room 
and three guards roaming the south part of the room. Take them out or avoid 
them and head south. In this area you will see an open door to your left and 
a closed door to your right. There will also be two guards patrolling the 
south part of the screen. Enter the door on the left and you will find MINES 
on a desk surrounded by three sleeping guards. Quietly take out the guards, 
grab the MINES, and exit the room. Avoid the guards and use CARD 1 to enter 
the door on the right. Inside you will find a POW. Rescue him and exit the 
room, avoid the guards, and head south. On the next screen you will see a 
gray colored floored. It is an electric floor, but it is not active. If the 
guard in this area sees you, he will turn on the electric floor. Use the crate 
to avoid the guard or take him out with a REMOTE CONTROLLED MISSLE and use 
CARD 3 to enter the door in the center of and grab the ---INFRARED GOGGLES---. 
Exit the room with the three guards. Take the lower path around to the sleeping 
guard. Take him out and head down. You will now be in the laser trap area 
from earlier. Use your INFRARED GOGGLES to se where the lasers are. Sneak 
through the first screen of lasers to the south and through the second screen 
of lasers and head west. In this area you will see two guards patrolling the 
area and a room in the middle of the area. Use CARD 3 to enter the room in 
the middle and rescue the POW. He will tell you that Dr. Pettrovich is confined 
to a solitary cell in the courtyard. Exit the room and use CARD 3 to enter 
the door on the left. In here you will find the second boss of the game, Machine 
Gun Kid. 

*****BOSS FIGHT #2*****
Machine Gun Kid   

Machine Gun Kid will run around the north part of the room firing several 
shots downward. Hide behind a wall in the south part of the room and use REMOTE 
CONTROLLED MISSLES to kill him. Four REMOTE CONTROLLED MISSLES should do the 
trick.

After the boss fight, go left to the next screen. Use CARD 1 to enter the 
enter the door in the north part of the room. In here you will find the ---IRON 
GLOVE---. Exit this room and head right. Enter the room in the middle of the 
screen to rescue the POW.


IV. Double Trouble:
One objective completed and another one gained. Your goal now is to find Dr. 
Pettrovich and find out information about Metal Gear.

From here you will need to head to the roof. But before you do that, now is 
a good time to restock your entire inventory. You should know where everything 
is in BUILDING ONE at this point in the game. After you restock your inventory, 
head to the elevator in the northeast part of the building. Take the elevator 
to the roof. When you exit the elevator, you will get a call from Big Boss. 
He will tell you that the wind barrier is extended on the roof and that you 
should look for a BOMB BLAST SUIT. If you listened to me earlier and got the 
BOMB BLAST SUIT from the STORAGE BUILDING, equip it for use on the roof. If 
not, then go back to the STORAGE BUILDING and get it. After you equipped the 
BOMB BLAST SUIT, head west. Here you will see three guards patrolling the 
area. Take them out or sneak past them and head west again from here. This 
screen will have two guards patrolling around a bunch of crates. This screen 
is also easy to get by on as long as you stay south and head west. Here will 
be one more guards. Take him out or sneak past him and head south to the next 
screen via the left path.  No guards here just enter the open door and grab 
the AMMO. Exit the room and continue south. Use CARD 2 to enter the room here 
and rescue the POW. Exit the room and head back to the screen with the two 
guards where you could go west or south. Head south from here. On this screen 
you will see a swaying bridge. You have to make it across the bridge. If you 
fall off, you die. It's tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of it. Just 
try to head straight down very slowly. On the next screen you have to do the 
exact same thing, but the bridge is swaying the other direction. Head down 
slowly and as straight as possible. Once across the bridge to the next screen, 
you will see a rocket man type guard just head west on the south part of the 
screen. Use the REMOTE CONTROLLED MISSLES to destroy the control panel to 
the electric floor in this area as well as the two guards and use CARD 3 to 
enter the room. Grab the ---MINE DETECTOR--- on the desk and exit the room. 
Head back to the screen after the bridge and head east. Here you will face 
more rocket guard troubles. Just run past them east to the next screen. On 
this screen you will fight boss number three, Twin Shot.

*****BOSS FIGHT #3*****
Twin Shot

Run up to the empty space next to the right twin and fire ten grenades from 
your GRENADE LAUNCHER to kill him. Run up to the empty space and do the same 
thing to the other. 

After the boss fight, head north. Enter the door on the left using CARD 2 
and the POW will tell you that Dr. Pettrovich is in +++BUILDING TWO+++.

     
V. Heavy Weapons:
After beating the "hardest" bass in any Metal Gear game, it is time to face 
two consecutive bosses.

Exit the room head all the way back to where you enter BUILDING ONE after 
you were captured. Go up three screens to fight the fourth boss of the game, 
the Tank. 


*****BOSS FIGHT #4*****
Tank 
           
The Tank will fire machine gun rounds at you. Hide behind the wall to stay 
away from it. When the tank backs up, place a MINE down in front of the Tanks 
path. It will hit the MINE when it comes forward. When placing the MINE, watch 
out for the missiles that it shoots out. If it hits you, it will likely kill 
you. To avoid getting hit by the missile, just place the MINE to the side 
of the missile cannon. Try to place two or three MINES at a time to make the 
battle quicker. You might need to use a RATION or two if your hit by his machine 
gun.

When the tank is destroyed, proceed north. This next screen is pretty much 
empty. Proceed on to the next screen. Here you will see three guards that 
immediately attack you. Take them out then Big Boss will then call you and 
tell you that you have reached a road block. He will tell you that you need 
an enemy uniform to sneak past the guards in this area. He will also inform 
you that his new frequency is 120.13. Make a note of that. End the transmission 
and equip the UNIFORM. Proceed forward and enter the door to go in BUILDING 
TWO. From the entrance of the building, head left. On this screen you will 
see two guards. One will be patrolling the northwest corner of the screen 
and the other will be patrolling the other side of the drainage system. Head 
up to the guard in the northwest corner of the screen and take him out. Use 
CARD 4 to enter the room. Grab the AMMO and exit the room. When you exit the 
room, take out the guard near you then proceed back to where you entered the 
building. From here, go down into the drainage system and head left. Run 
through the drainage system and use CARD 4 to enter the door in the drainage 
system. If the guards see you, just ignore them and keep going. In this room 
the fifth boss of the game, the Bulldozer, will confront you.

*****BOSS FIGHT #5*****
Bulldozer

When you enter this room the Bulldozer will be slowly approaching you. You 
must defeat it before it crushes you. Exit the room and equip your GRENADE 
LAUNCHER. Enter the room again and fire the grenades at him as fast as you 
can. After it is hit with eight grenades, it will explode and the path will 
be cleared. 

Use CARD 4 to enter the next room. In this room you will see five laser walls. 
Equip your INFRARED GOGGLES to see the lasers. The lasers will flash in 
different directions. Get past them and enter the elevator take the elevator 
to the roof.


VI. Double Trouble, Part II:
In this section you will complete another objective and gain another 
objective. This is one of the hardest areas in the game. There are tons of 
guards in this area so be careful.

The second you enter the roof; you will see three guards. Take them out and 
use CARD 2 to enter the room on the left. Inside you will find a POW. Rescue 
him and exit the room and proceed east. Here you'll see four guards. Sneak 
past them and head south. On this screen three guards will be patrolling the 
south area. Take out the one you encounter and head south again. The next 
area will have one of those rocket guards. Take him out and use CARD 4 to 
enter the door in the center of the screen. Inside you will find ---CARD 5---. 
Grab it, exit the room, and head east. Another rocket guard is here. Take 
him out and use CARD 5 to enter the room. Once again a rocket guard will greet 
you. Run past him and us CARD 5 to enter the elevator. Take the elevator down 
to the first floor. 

Once you exit the elevator you will see two guards. Take them out and use 
CARD 5 to exit the room. Head left in this room and then head left again in 
the next. Take out guard, enter door. Grab RATION, kill guard, head right, 
then north. Enter the door on the left using CARD 2, taking out the guards 
first. Grab the ---ANTENNA--- and Big Boss will call you and tell you that 
the ANTENNA was blocking your communications. Exit, take out guards, head 
right. Can you tell I'm getting board yet? Two guards will attack you here 
take them out and go north. Use CARD 5 to enter. Rescue the POW and he will 
tell you that the drainage system will lead you to +++BUILDING THREE+++. Exit 
and head to where you could enter the water, just before the room with the 
ANTENNA. Enter it and follow the north shallow part of the water around. Get 
out of the water and go down and around the path, killing the guard along 
the way. Enter the room and you will find ---CARD 6---. Follow the path back

guards here and enter the room in the middle of the screen. In here you will 
rescue the POW. He will tell you to call Jennifer at 120.48. Exit the room 
and call Jennifer at 120.48. If you don't have a four star ranking, she won't 
answer you. If you rescued all the POWs that I told you to rescue up to this 
point, then you shouldn't have a problem. She will tell you that she can 
arrange a ===ROCKET LAUNCHER=== for you to pickup. Go to the room with the 
next boss and go into the right door using CARD 5. Enter the far door in this 
room and take out the guards first. Inside here will be the ROCKET LAUNCHER.

room and enter the open door on the northwest corner of the room. Lost of 
AMMO here. Take it all and head back to finally face the Arnolds.

*****BOSS FIGHT #6*****
Arnolds 

The Arnolds are pretty easy to beat. Just stand in front of them and launch 
four rockets at each of them. The only way they can touch you is by running 
up and touching you. Use a RATION if needed during this fight. After the fight 
is over, collect ---CARD 7--- that they leave behind.

After the fight with the Arnolds, use CARD 2 to exit the room via the door 
in the northeast corner. Kill the guard in front of you and proceed east.

on the north part of the room around to the next screen where you exit. The

VII. Ambushed:
After that rather boring part of the game, you now get to play the role of 
the hero is rescuing not one, not two, but THREE important characters in the 
game. Won't you feel proud of yourself? 
 
Equip the COMPASS and go north several screens through the SCORPION DESERT. 
Kill the scorpions along the way. If a scorpion touches you, use the ANTIDOTE 
to heal yourself of the poison. When you arrive in the JUNGLE, continue 
heading north and you will reach BUILDING THREE. Big Boss will then contact 
you and tell you to get in the truck on the right. Enter the bottom truck 
to get some AMMO. Exit the truck and use CARD 7 to enter the building. Guards 
will rush you when you enter the building. It seems as if they almost knew 
you were coming... Head to the left and Big Boss will contact you and tell 
you to enter the door on the left. DON'T DO IT!!! It is a trap! Instead, head 
up to the next screen while hugging the right wall. This room has several 
pits that open. Hug the right side of the room and get rid of the pits as 
necessary. Enter the elevator and take it down to the 100th floor basement 
and exit the elevator. This room will have two laser-firing cameras on the 
north wall. They are easy to avoid if you hide behind the wall in the center 
of the room. Use CARD 7 to enter the south door and grab the ---OXYGEN TANK---. 
Head back up the elevator and exit the building. Head back across the SCORPION 
DESERT to BUILDING TWO.

When you're back at BUILDING TWO, head right. Now equip your OXYGEN TANK and 
swim north. Keep swimming north until you come to shallow water. Get out of 
the water; avoid the guards, and head north (head north directly in front 
of where you got out of the water). On this screen you will see an electrified 
floor. Use your REMOTE-CONTROLLED MISSLES to destroy the control panel next 
to the door on the left. Enter the door on the left using CARD 1. Inside you 
will find two boxes of AMMO. Take the AMMO and exit the room. Use CARD 7 to 
enter the door on the right. In here you will find the seventh boss of the 
game, Coward Duck.

*****BOSS FIGHT #7*****
Coward Duck

At the start of the fight, you will get a call from Jennifer. She will tell 
you that Coward Duck has ---CARD 8---. She will also tell you that her brother 
is among one of the captives so don't kill and of the POWs. After the 
transmission, head north along the left wall. Now head up hugging the boxes 
and rescue the POW on the left. Now use you HANDGUN to kill Coward Duck. 10 
shots should do it with ease. After the fight, grab CARD 8 that Coward Duck 
leaves. Rescue the POW on the right and the POW in the center, who is 
Jennifer's brother. When you rescue him, he will tell you that he is 
Jennifer's brother. He will tell you that when escaping Outer Heaven take 
the left elevator. Now exit the room and head back to the SCORPION DESERT.

Once you reach the screen after the SCORPION DESERT, head left three screens, 
up one screen, and then left one more time. Use CARD 6 to enter the STORAGE 
BUILDING. Schneider will call you and tell you that there is a gas filled 
room up ahead. Use CARD 5 to enter the upper left door and rescue the POW 
inside. Exit the room and use CARD 3 to enter the door on the upper right. 
Equip your GAS MASK and head up. Enter the door to your north and find PLASTIC 
EXPLOSIVES and a rolling pin. Avoid the rolling pin and grab the PLASTIC 
EXPLOSIVES. Exit and head left. Go around to the open door and inside you 
will find the ---FLASHLIGHT---. Grab the FLASHLIGHT and exit the room. Punch 
the wall to the left a little bit above the doorway and enter it. In here 
you will fight the eighth boss of the game, Fire Trooper.

 *****BOSS FIGHT #8*****
Fire Trooper

Fire Trooper will stand by the door and fire his flamethrower at you. Run 
up to behind him or right next to him and unload on him with your HANDGUN. 
About ten shots should put an end to Flame Troopers torching. You might need 
to use a RATION if you were touched by his flame or him while running up to 
him.

After the fight, use CARD 6 to enter the door behind Fire Trooper. Inside 
you will find Dr. Pettrovich. He will ask you to rescue his daughter who is 
located in this same building. Go back to where you entered the building and 
use CARD 5 to open the left door. Equip your GAS MASK again and punch the 
north wall. Enter the door that you just found. Follow the path around and 
use CARD 1 to enter the room. Rescue the POW and exit and continue following 
the path. Use CARD 5 to enter the next room where you will find RATIONS. Exit 
the room and continue following the path to the right and then down. On this 
screen, punch a little bit below the middle of the left wall and enter the 
doorway. Punch the northwest wall on the far side of the screen and enter 
the room to find some AMMO. Exit the room and use CARD 6 to open the southern 
door. Diane will call you and tell you not to fall into any enemy pit traps. 
Use your FLASHLIGHT so you can see in the room. Head south several screens, 
avoiding the pits in the open areas. Use CARD 1 to open the southern door. 
In here you will find four dogs. Easily take them out and head south. You 
will encounter two guards here, take them out and use CARD 6 to enter the 
door on the right.  Hug the wall and head right. In the middle of the right 
wall, punch it and enter the room. Inside you will find Ellen Pettrovich, 
Dr. Pettrovich's daughter. Rescue her and head out of the two rooms. Use CARD 
6 to enter the southern door. You are now in the place where you escaped from 
earlier in the game. Head right and use CARD 3 to exit the building. Head 
right two screens and then head south two screens. Ride the middle truck and 
then exit that truck, kill the guards, and ride the right truck. Exit that, 
kill the guard, and ride the right truck again. Exit it and head down. Then 
head left three screens, up one screen, and left again to get back to the 
STORAGE BUILDING. Go back to Dr. Pettrovich and he will tell you that in order 
to destroy the Super Computer that operates Metal Gear, you need to place 
16 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES on each side of it in a certain order. That order is 
R, R, L, R, L, L, R, L, L, R, R, L, R, L, R, R. Now exit the STORAGE BUILDING 
and head back to BUILDING THREE to destroy Metal Gear once and for all!     

IX. The Traitor:
You need all the PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES you can get so stock up on those before 
to proceed. Now once you get back to BUILDING THREE, head back to the 100th 
floor basement. As soon as you arrive at the 100th floor basement, avoid the 
cameras and use CARD 8 to enter the door on the right wall. Don't worry too 
much about the camera seeing you. All it will do is fire a laser at you, it 
won't alert the guards. Enter the room and rescue the POW. He will tell you 
that the leader of Outer Heaven is none other than.....................the 
Commander-in-Chief of FOX-HOUND, Big Boss! Exit the room and head west. Big 
Boss will call you and tell you to stop the operation at once! Ignore him 
of course. This screen has one camera on each of the walls facing south. Run 
past them and use CARD 8 to enter the door on the north wall. Equip your GAS 
MASK and head up to the northeast part of the room. Punch the wall until you 
hear that strange tapping sound. Use a PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE to blow up the wall. 
Head through the passage to enter the next room. Head along the left wall 
of the room until you reach the door. Use CARD 1 to enter. This room has MINES 
and gas. Equip you MINE DETECTOR and quickly move through the room. Use CARD 
1 to enter the door. This room has an electric floor with no switch. Jennifer 
will call you and tell you that you must run through it as quick as you can. 
Run through it as quick as you can and enter the open door on the north wall. 
Before entering the door, heal yourself with a RATION. Through the door is 
the ninth boss of the game, the all-powerful Super Computer.

*****BOSS FIGHT #9*****
Super Computer

To defeat the Super Computer, you must use PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES and the order 
that Dr. Pettrovich gave you earlier. Put the PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES on his feet 
in the order R, R, L, R, L, L, R, L, L, R, R, L, R, L, R, R. There are four 
soldiers in this room as well, dispose of them first.

When you place all 16 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES in the correct place, the Super 
Computer will explode taking the two cameras with it and setting off the Outer 
Heaven self-destruct system. A timer will appear on the bottom of the screen 
and an emergency message will appear in a text box. The door to your left 
will then open. Heal yourself with a RATION. Enter the door to fight your 
final battle.

*****BOSS FIGHT #10*****
Big Boss

Big Boss will tell you that you were sent here to get false information on 
Metal Gear, but you accomplished too much. He will tell you that you have 
crushed his ambitions. He will then say that he will not die alone and that 
you are coming with him. Diane then calls you and tells you that she doesn't 
know how to defeat Big Boss. The fight begins. You must use your ROCKET 
LAUNCHER to defeat Big Boss. 5-10 hits with the ROCKET LAUNCHER should take 
care of the traitor. Use the crates for protection from his gunshots. The 
BODY ARMOR also comes in handy for that too. Use a RATION or two if needed.

After the fight, smoke some CIGARETTES to give yourself more time to escape. 
The door on the north wall will open. Enter the door. There will be three 
ladders. Climb the one on the left like Jennifer's brother told you to do 
earlier. Climb up to the surface and it will cut to a scene where Solid Snake 
is running away from Outer Heaven just as it explodes. Solid Snake then calls 
Big Boss's frequency and says that Metal Gear was destroyed and Operation 
Intrude N313 was a success. He then tunes into a radio station and they saw 
that there was a large explosion at Outer Heaven around midnight. The credits 
will then role and the screen will fade to black. Congratulations, you've 
just completed Metal Gear. Now it's time to pop in the sequel, Metal Gear 
2: Solid Snake for MSX. Check out my FAQ/Walkthrough for it as well.
