There's not much to say about basics of this game, since you only have to go
forward while throwing your weapons in several directions. There are however,
chests that appear throughout the game and they contain either a wizard that
transforms you into either a duck or an old man; or a door that takes you to
another dimension and you have to pick either equipment or having more health
or Magic.

 The equipment you can pick is body armor, legging, helmets or weapons. They
also vary in color -- silver, red, green and golden (these go from weakest to
strongest). That's about it, there's no special jumping, no nothing.

 There are 6 levels in total and each level is divided in 2 areas, so let's get
started. I recorded a complete playthrough of the game and you can find it in
my channel, so take a look if you're stuck with something.

-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #1-1                                                              sx301
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 We start the game in the Place of Execution, and since it's the first stage of
the game, I recommend you getting a grip on how Arthur moves (note that he
slides when you turn very quickly). Anyway, let's get started.

 From where we start, there will be some Reaper enemies coming out of the
ground and run towards you. They appear through the whole area, so you'll have
to deal with them. When you get to a ladder, a chest appears behind you next to
the tree. Open it and proceed right. There are some flying enemies on the next
tree, so get under them and shoot them from beneath.

 When you get to another set of stairs, another chest shall appear. Follow
either the upper path or the lower on, wait for the blades of the guillotines
to go up and run pass them. There's another guillotine next to the chest and
before the guillotine, another chest should appear.

 Now run right past the giant guillotine and you'll get to the next area.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #1-2                                                              sx302
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 It's rainy right here, meaning that you'll be pushed backwards. There are some
spinning demons in this area, but just evade them by either crouching or
jumping and keep going forward before they catch you. As you proceed, a chest
should pop out of nowhere (that's when the wind stops).

 You'll be at the bottom of a mountain. Another new enemy appears. It looks
like a flower that spits out 3 skulls that go in 3 different directions. It's
pretty easy to evade so go right until you hit a ladder. Take it up, then the
next one too. Go left after the second ladder, go up the ladder and a new enemy
appears, which looks like a butcher.

 Hit it hard and go left, up the ladder and go right. When you get to a big
blue door, a chest appears before it. Hit it to have a door appear and you'll
be in your first boss fight.

 ---- Dullahan -----------------------------------------------------

 This boss is pretty easy and you should have no problems with it. You need to
take out the head, which is floating around. It spits out fireballs, but they
go so slow that it's really easy to evade them. When you evade one fireball, go
under the head and shoot nonstop. Also, watch out for the knee, because if you
get to close it'll hit you.

 Now grab the blue key.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now simply run through the door to get to the next area.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #2-1                                                              sx303
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 My most hated stage in the whole damn game. A new enemy makes its appearance
in this stage. It's a skull that bounces around and if you're near it, it
transforms into a turtle. Run underneath the bouncing skulls and if anyone
transforms into a turtle, take it down. When you get to something blue that
comes out of the ground, on the other side of it is a little pit. In this pit
is a chest. Open it up.

 When you get to the top of the path, there's some sand going down. DO NOT go
down, because there's an Antlion down here and it'll rip you a new a**hole.
Instead, go up the bridges. But beware though, because they break. I'll tell
you where they break. The first one breaks three squares before it ends (note
that each section that breaks has a 4 block length).

 Then next bridge breaks after the first block and if you fall, you'll go down
right into the Antlion and if you get swallowed by the sand, you'll instantly
die. The next bridge, I really don't know where it breaks, but you can just
drop down and jump you way to the top of the sand hill. Once up here, the next
bridge breaks in middle of it.

 Run to the other side of the second sand pit (the bridges break on either
side) and under this last bridge, there's a chest. There's nothing to the far
right end, so ignore it. Hop on top of the last bridge and go 2 more bridges
left, then go up the top right one.

 <vin> If you want to go to the top left bridge of the whole area, there's
       another chest.

 It breaks at the start of it (on the fourth block I believe) and just before
the chest at the end. There's also an enemy, but it's not a boss. You can use
thunder to hit him whenever he's coming after you. Next stage.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #2-2                                                              sx304
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 Ok now, I died a ton in this stage, all because of a stupid jump. There's
another enemy here, a Fire Bat. They just go down in a semi hoop and go back
up. Jump over the first gap, while evading the Fire Bat. When you get to a
lower platform, a chest appears. The jump after the chest is the bitch. It took
me several minutes to get past this jump.

 Jump on top of the pillars then some fire pillars will start dropping. After
they disappear, from the dots that remain, a Fire Bat will appear from it.
There's also another enemy that looks like a plant. Duck to destroy it. Go up
the ladder when you come to it and keep going right. Take care of the plants
ASAP. At the end, there's a chest and a Boss Fight.

 ---- Cerberus -----------------------------------------------------

 This boss is easy. What happens is that there are some fireballs that drop
from the ceiling. Also, Cerberus appears from the right and just gets to the
center of the screen. Then it jumps over you (you won't get hurt by this) and
go the same thing on this other side. This is all it does, so attack it, go to
the other side, wait for it to jump over and keep attacking it. All this while
evading the fireballs of course.

 Another better tactic is to use Thunder. With 2 strikes from it and it's dead.

 Now grab the blue key.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #3-1                                                              sx305
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 This stage isn't that bad, not as bad as the previous one (damn you 2-1). As
you can see, it looks like you're on a lone platform, but it moves along with
you, so it's like if the floor is complete, so don't worry about falling. There
are also purple enemies that are static and don't move, so just stay out of
their range and you'll do just fine.

 The little green enemies drop a stone and then come down in an S-like shape.
Just shoot it down! And since the stage scrolls automatically, there's no
specific walkthrough, but only some pointers. When the screen scrolls to the
right, start sticking to the right side and when the path closes up, start
shooting the purple enemies on the top, because you need to take care of them.

 Right after these 2 purple enemies, on the right side appears a chest. Look
out for the right part of the stage on the upper left because it'll squash you
so grab the chest and start running to the left. There's also a purple pillar
that has green orbs. Destroy 2 of them and run to the right and enter the door
at the top.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #3-2                                                              sx306
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 Now this is a pretty messed up stage. Stay away from the mouths because if you
approach them, they'll eat you up. Start by ducking passing under the mouth,
then jump on the upper purple tongue. Jump over the blue flame and DO NOT jump
over at the end of the tongue. Wait for some platforms to appear on the bottom
(only 2 platforms appear at a time) and jump down.

 Another chest appears under the next tongue, and another one under the next
one. Jump on the right tongue (the one that's going upwards) and DUCK, because
the rock spire will kill you even if you have full health -- so duck and jump
right over the blue flame. On the other side of the flame, there are more
platforms that move, but on the other direction (from right to left).

 Jump across them and a chest appears right under the tip of the tongue. Move
across the next 2 tongues until you get to a platform (finally!). Jump across
the platforms until you get to the gate, and you know what that means.

 ---- Cloud? -------------------------------------------------------

 Ok, this Boss is a lot harder than the previous ones. Like all bosses, it only
has 1 attack. It'll drop down several "thunders" in a wide area. Run to the
right side of the area and start charging your Fire magic. When it's in range,
attack it. Repeat. If the thunders get to close, try jumping them.

 If you get hit, use your invincibility time to attack it with your normal
weapon (lances, daggers, etc). Rinse and repeat the whole process (if you have
the Shield spell at this point in the game, use it and physically attack it).
It takes 8 Fire spells to defeat it.

 Now grab the blue key.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #4-1                                                              sx307
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 We are in a cavern now. Please notice the green spikes on the ceiling.
Touching these will hurt you, it's not an automatically kill, but nevertheless,
avoid them further ahead. Remember the reapers from the first stage? They
appear here once again. When you get to a large bone, go on top of it and
you'll see a chest. Continue right and another chest appears just before you
drop down.

 There's an enemy here that looks like a piece of s***, seriously. Jump over
its fireball attack and kill it. When the path forks again (with a chest),
continue right and a chest shall appear just before the step. Another chest
appears right before you descend.

 Now simply run right and enter the door to the next area.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #4-2                                                              sx308
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 Oh man, I don't like this stage. The green ceiling is here again, so avoid
them. The only enemy in this stage are those hands that shoot out fireballs
like those pieces of s***. DO NOT approach these hands, because they'll grab
you and kill you automatically. Use Fire from a distance to take care of these.

 The path is linear, so you don't need a guide for this part, so see ya at the
bottom of the waterfalls. There's a green thingy here. Jump on it and it'll
start descending. When you see another green thingy on the left side, jump on
it then on the other one on the left. Jump once more on the left one then jump
on the right one and follow them to the right Until you get to the floor.

 The gate is here, yay!

 ---- Alligator? ----------------------------------------------------

 Another annoying boss. It has no attacks, but there are some things that will
hurt you. There are four orange orbs that come out of the boss, one after
another in a straight line. They don't home in at you, so you can easily evade
them. Now notice the circular thingies on the body of the boss. You need to
jump and attack them.

 But oh wait! There are some damn Maggots that come out of the boss and attack
you. Just attack them once and focus on the circular thingies of the boss.
There are 5 of these thingies, so take them all out.

 Now grab the blue key.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #5-1                                                              sx309
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 Finally last 2 stages of the game. Kill the enemies on top (easy enough) and a
chest will appear (whether you kill the enemies or not). Go up the ladder on
the right and right after you descend, a flying enemy will appear (the same
enemy from the previous stage). The best way to deal with it is to use Fire
from a distance before it starts moving like crazy.

 Go up the ladder to the right, go up the next one and start moving left. There
are 2 more of these flying enemies, so take care of them. A chest appears in
between these 2 enemies. Go up the ladder at the end, go up the ladder, then go
down the ladder to your right. Follow this path of going up and down the stairs
and when you get to the top, go right and end this stage.


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage #5-2                                                              sx310
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 Go right and a chest will appear. Now go right and there's a really hard part
of the game. I recommend you checking out my video in YouTube
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g_vzHduYOU) at 01:27. I'll try to explain
here, but I dunno how well it'll go. Please notice the faces on both sides of
the ladder, where the balls are coming from.
               _                 _____________________________________________A
   _    |     |-|     |    _    |                                             V
 ,' `.  |     |-|     |  ,' `.  |  Let's imagine it's something like this. Stay
(  5  ) |     |-|     | (     ) | right under the first face and watch the
 `._,'  |     |-|     |  `._,'  | movement of the balls carefully. Take note
   _    |     |-|     |    _    | when the balls move like this: 2left, then

(  4  ) |     |-|     | (     ) | 1right again. When this ball passes, move up

   _    |     |-|     |    _    | and 1right at the same time. When this

   _    |     |-|     |    _    | face, wait for a ball from 5left to pass and
 ,' `.  |     |-|     |  ,' `.  | climb to the top.
(  2  ) |     |-|     | (     ) |
 `._,'  |     |-|     |  `._,'  |  Got that? No? Then watch the vid. Once at
   _    |     |-|     |    _    | the top, from the door that's there, an
 ,' `.  |     |-|     |  ,' `.  | awkward enemy appears. It only spits a line
(  1  ) |     |-|     | (     ) | of fire with a rather short range. Simply
 `._,'  |     |-|     |  `._,'  | jump and attack the head. Past this enemy,
                                | a chest will appear. Open it and go up the
o-------------------------------' ladder.

 Remember the first boss? The Dullahan? Well, there are 2 of these at the same
time, but without the body, just the head. They attack the same, so take care
of them. After you do so, a path will appear to the right. Follow it, and on
top of the stairs, another chest will appear. Is the door next to the chest
familiar? Yep, another one of those awkward enemies will appear, but there may
be 2 of them.

 What do I mean with that? Well, there's supposed to be a battle against 2 of
these at the same time, but run to the right slowly and you're exactly in front
of its attack. If done correctly, you can defeat it without the other one
appearing from behind. Once done this, at the top of the steps is another
chest, but be careful. Remember the Cloud boss? Well, the babies of it will
appear.

 They just go in circles, but they are hard to hit, so take your time. There
are 3 of them and they'll come out one after another. Now go up the platforms,
go up the ladder and a chest should appear on the left side. Now go right to
find another Dullahan (which shoots faster this time) and some of those bats
from the stage 3-1. Kill the bats, then focus on the Dullahan.

 Go up the ladder behind it and another boss triggers here.

 ---- Beelzebub -----------------------------------------------------

 This boss is easy, and I really mean in this time. It'll start as some red
flies on the left side of the screen. Run to the right and when Beelzebub
starts forming itself, look up and attack its head. It'll shoot some things
from the tail, but they shouldn't hurt you from where you are.

 If you didn't kill it for some reason, it'll do the same thing: turn into red
flies and go to the left and reform itself. Go under it and attack it.

 Now grab the blue key.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------


-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
 Stage Finale                                                            sx311
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

 To enter the last stage, you need to have all your equipment maxed out.

Head: Gold
Body: Gold
Shoes: Gold
Weapon: Psycho Blaster

 Note that when you open a door with your armor in golden state and the last
weapon (Discus), there's a chance that you'll obtain the Psycho Blaster, which
is required to defeat Loki. If you're not maxed out, they'll either send you
back to the beginning of the game (if you don't have your armor all golden) or
at the beginning of stage 5-1 if you're only lacking the Psycho Blaster.

 Now the only thing to do here is to kill Loki, the easiest boss in the game,
seriously.

 ---- Loki ---------------------------------------------------------

 Since you're already maxed out, you should have the Shield spell. Use it and
stand on a skull that's right under Loki's d***. As you can see, the floor
starts disappearing. Keep attacking like for like 5 seconds tops and you'll
defeat him... what disappointment.
