1) This game is one of the original groundbreakers for Nintendo that has
   enraptured fans for years.  You are a racer who wears red, and you can
   challenge the course by yourself, or with some fellow racers (decked out
   in blue and green outfits).  You need to finish in the top 3 in a race to
   advance onwards, and this becomes incredibly difficult after the first 
   couple of races.  If you have never played this classic, simple, 
   addictive, incredibly fun game, then I suggest you try to in any way 
   possible to relive a game that is beloved of many NES fans.

2) This section is going to look at how the controller helps you to achieve
   dirt bike racing greatness.


                          o-----------------o
                          | Selection A & B |
                          o-----------------o

D-Pad...: UP and DOWN move you in corresponding directions on the track.  
          LEFT moves the bike front wheel up (pull back), and RIGHT moves 
          the bike front wheel down (push forward).  This is only relevant 
          when in the air (ie RIGHT), but the LEFT command can be used to
          drive over tiny speed bumps safely.

SELECT..: Moves cursor flag between play modes, and also track numbers.

START...: Picks play mode, and track number.  Also pauses/unpauses the game.

B Button: Uses the faster gear for your bike, but it can overheat you.

A Button: Uses the slower gear for your bike, but it will not overheat you.


                              o--------o
                              | Design |
                              o--------o

D-Pad...: LEFT and RIGHT move your cursor to a new formation to build.

SELECT..: Moves your cursor through the selections available in this mode.

START...: Picks selection.

B Button: Builds your selected obstacle.

A Button: Moves the dirt bike so you can continue to design your course.

------------------------------Game Modes------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) This section will review what each game mode entails.


                            o-------------o
                            | Selection A |
                            o-------------o

-This setting is just you vs. the course.  This is an excellent place for a
 player to begin their days of Excitebike playing.  This will allow a player
 to learn the ropes, and yet still be challenged by the harder courses, as
 they progress.


                            o-------------o
                            | Selection B |
                            o-------------o

-This setting is you vs. the course vs. opponents.  This is a tougher
 challenge for a player, because the opponents can wipe you out, and also
 cut you off (keeping your speed lower since you do not want to crash).  
 Although they are annoying, it adds a new dimension to the tracks you have
 come to know and love while playing Selection A.  This will give you a
 fresh look at the fun you have had the first time through.


                               o--------o
                               | Design |
                               o--------o

-This setting is you vs. YOUR COURSE.  You are the designer, so you can make
 it as easy, or as incredibly difficult for you to finish.  This is also an
 excellent way for a group of friends to challenge each other in turn
 alternating challenge of who can get the fastest time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------Design Guides---------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) This section will go over what letter builds what shape, but it will also
   show a diagram of each obstacle.  These drawings are not exact replicas,
   but it should give you an idea of what you are looking for.


A - A small bump jump that poses little speed loss, but also little airtime.

B - A slightly taller bump jump, that can pose some speed loss, but will 
    give more airtime.

C - The largest of the bump jump series, this one can really sap your speed,
    but it will give some great air if you hit it with some speed.

D - This one is a shallower slope, but it is a prolonged slope.  Not very
    good for airtime.

E - This is a steep slope, but it gives an excellent angle to get great 
    airtime.

F - Sloped to give you an easier climb, and a better angle to jump.  This is
    an opportune piece to get huge airtime off of.

G - The mirror piece of the above.  It has a harsh slope, and this means
    less airtime.

H - This is the ultimate jumping piece.  It is a 45 degree angle (optimum
    angle), and it is short so no loss of speed.

I - This is a small speed bump that appears on the top two sections of the
    courses.

J - This is a small speed bump that appears on the bottom two sections of
    the courses.

K - Two piles of dirt, located in sections 1 and 3 on the course.

L - Two piles of dirt, located in sections 2 and 4 on the course.

M - This is an engine cooler.  It is especially helpful since it allows you
    to use your stronger gear more often.  This appears on the 1st section
    of the track.

N - This is an engine cooler.  It is especially helpful since it allows you
    to use your stronger gear more often.  This appears on the 3rd section
    of the track.

O - Is a patch of grass found on the bottom two sections of the track.

P - Is a patch of grass found on the top two sections of the track.

Q - Is a patch of grass that cuts off the track completely (usually found in
    an area where a jump can be used to clear it).

R - This is a large, many angled monstrosity that can give many riders fits
    if they can not use it properly.  It is the largest obstacle you face.

S - Has a big overhang on the top two sections, but the bottom two contains
    pathway with dirt piles to slow you down.


   After you finish your designed course, just go to END, press B, and then
   set lap number with D-Pad, and then press B to confirm.  This will bring
   you back to the DESIGN menu, where you can choose a play mode, or another
   available option.  Also, remember I am representing 2.5 D pictures with
   2 D drawings, so not all of them will appear quite the same as in the 
   game.

5) This section is going to look at the first track map, and strategies for
   various parts/combos/sections of this course.  The course will be drawn
   left to right, and it will just move down to the next part when room runs
   out (it will be easy to follow).  I will be using the design letters for
   identifying obstacles as well as drawings.

   This is the course map for track 1, and now you will recieve a strategy
   to follow.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#1 |
                                  o--------o

Start by using your B gear to get out quickly, and go over the first four 
bumps, and straighten your bike out in the air (see Strategies section for
details) so you will land smoothly (and lose no speed).


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#2 |
                                  o--------o

Traverse the triple set of 'B' bumps, and make sure to drive near the top of
the track so you can grab the cool down area.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#3 |
                                  o--------o

Avoid the dirt (you should be back in B gear), and jump from 'F' to 'G', take
the awesome 'H' jump, and then get another cool down area just before taking 
to the air on another 'H' jump.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#4 |
                                  o--------o

Take yet another 'H' jump, and fly over the four small bumps.  Then keep 
your speed up so you can try to clear the grass field off of the 'F' jump.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#5 |
                                  o--------o

Then you just need to navigate the 'D' bumps, and then slalom the dirt 
piles, and finish the lap.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#6 |
                                  o--------o

Repeat Step#1 through Step#5 to easily get under one minute, and on to track
2.

   This is the course map for track 2, and now you will receive a strategy
   to follow.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#1 |
                                  o--------o

Start by using the B gear to get out quickly, and then let your bike hit the
first upward slope of the multi-angled monstrosities ('R' obstacles), change 
to A gear, and then lean bike forward to run down opposite slope.  Use A gear
till you see the dirt piles, and then switch to B gear so you can hit the 'R'
obstacle fast enough to use the same strategy.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#2 |
                                  o--------o

Use the cool down area, and get over the 'B' obstacles quickly.  Then you 
need to hit the 'A' obstacle, and pull back slightly on the bike so you will 
not wipe out on the 'E' obstacle.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#3 |
                                  o--------o

Ignore the jump, and use the small 'A' obstacle to clear most of the grass.  
Cut upwards towards the next jump, and then fly the next grass patch.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#4 |
                                  o--------o

Move to the bottom of the track to get a cool down, and use your refreshed 
engine to navigate quickly through the 'D' obstacles.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#5 |
                                  o--------o

Then it is a simple matter of avoiding the slow down obstacles, and drive 
over the lap counter.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#6 |
                                  o--------o

Repeat Step#1 through Step#5 to qualify easily for the next race.

------------------------Track 3 Map, Stats, And Strategy--------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) This section is going to look at the third track map, some stats needed 
   to advance, and strategies for various parts/combos/sections of this
   course.  The course will be drawn left to right, and it will just move
   down to the next part when room runs out (it will be easy to follow).  I
   will be using the design letters for identifying obstacles as well as
   drawings.

   This is the course map for track 3, and now you will receive a strategy
   to follow.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#1 |
                                  o--------o

Start by using the B gear to get out quickly, and prepare to pull back on 
your bike so you can pop-a-wheelie.  Then navigate the 'B' obstacles.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#2 |
                                  o--------o

Shoot over the 'F'/'G' obstacles, and use a cool down so you can open your 
B gear up once more.  Continue off of obstacle 'F', and bounce off of the 
'G' obstacle (straighten the bike out after this).


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#3 |
                                  o--------o

Avoid the grass patch here, and then cut to the top half of the track to jump
most of the grass patch.  Then use the B gear to regain enough speed so you 
can use the next jump to fly over a 'C' obstacle.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#4 |
                                  o--------o

Watch out for the lone speed bump, and while maintaining a good speed launch 
off of the 'C' obstacle, bounce off of the 'G' obstacle, go over the 'B', 
and then the 'C' quickly.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#5 |
                                  o--------o

Use the cool down at the top, and switch to full B gear as you cut below the
grass patch, then above the following one.  Avoid the speed bump, and then 
slalom the two dirt piles, and avoid the last speed bump.  Then just drive 
over the lap counter.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#6 |
                                  o--------o

Repeat Step#1 through Step#5 to qualify easily for the next race.

------------------------Track 4 Map, Stats, And Strategy--------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8) This section is going to look at the third track map, some stats needed 
   to advance, and strategies for various parts/combos/sections of this
   course.  The course will be drawn left to right, and it will just move
   down to the next part when room runs out (it will be easy to follow).  I
   will be using the design letters for identifying obstacles as well as
   drawings.

   This is the course map for track 4, and now you will receive a strategy
   to follow.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#1 |
                                  o--------o

Start by using the B gear to get out quickly, and get to the top two sections
of the track, and ride the overhang of obstacle 'S'.  Slalom the dirt piles, 
and then once more stay on the top two sections of the track to ride the 
overhang of 'S'.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#2 |
                                  o--------o

Ride off of it (making sure not to wipe on 'B'), and then it is 
pop-a-wheelie over the speed bumps (stay on bottom part for cool down area)! 
Then use 'B' to get maximum air time to avoid most of the grass.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#3 |
                                  o--------o

Dodge the first jump, but use the second one to fly over the one 'C', and 
two 'A' obstacles.  Stay on top two parts, pop-a-wheelie to go over speed 
bump, and use the jump to get past the three 'C' obstacles.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#4 |
                                  o--------o

Use the cool down arrow, and then cut down to the bottom (while avoiding the
dirt pile), and go under the large grass area.  Cut up to avoid another grass
area, and pull back to pop-a-wheelie so you will maintain your speed for...


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#5 |
                                  o--------o

At full speed (B gear), you go off the first (of five) 'C', straighten the 
bike in the air (you will go down slope of #2 'C'), and then same deal for 
#3 'C' (jump then straighten), land (#4 'C') and then use #5 'C' to get as 
far over the grass patch as possible.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#6 |
                                  o--------o

Use cool down arrow, then slalom the dirt piles, and use the jump to clear 
the lap counter.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#7 |
                                  o--------o

Repeat Step#1 through Step#6 to qualify for the next race.

------------------------Track 5 Map, Stats, And Strategy--------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9) This section is going to look at the fourth track map, some stats needed 
   to advance, and strategies for various parts/combos/sections of this
   course.  The course will be drawn left to right, and it will just move
   down to the next part when room runs out (it will be easy to follow).  I
   will be using the design letters for identifying obstacles as well as
   drawings.

   This is the course map for track 5, and now you will receive a strategy
   to follow.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#1 |
                                  o--------o

Start by using the B gear to get out quickly, and go between the dirt piles,
then take the jump.  Bounce off of the 'G' obstacle, then make sure to match
your slope to the monstrous 'R' obstacle.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#2 |
                                  o--------o

Quickly move over the three 'A', and then move to bottom row, pop-a-wheelie, 
and hit the cool down area.  Head to the top while avoiding the dirt piles 
to take the jump.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#3 |
                                  o--------o

As you land, be ready to handle three 'C' obstacles, and then a 'F' to jump 
the grass patch.  Then go take the 'S' overhang, and cut down when you reach 
the end, go over the 'B', avoid the first jump, and utilize the second jump.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#4 |
                                  o--------o

You will come down on a 'C', so quickly scoot over it.  Then you must get a 
good speed up to get through two 'D', one 'A', and then four 'A' obstacles.  
Then climb the 'C' obstacle to get to the flat section of the course.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#5 |
                                  o--------o

Slalom the dirt piles avoid/pop-a-wheelie to get by the speed bumps, then 
slalom the remaining dirt piles, and stick to the top two sections to get 
past the last speed bump and over the lap counter.


                                  o--------o
                                  | Step#6 |
                                  o--------o

Repeat Step#1 through Step#5 to win the last track.


   You can keep going on, but the times will shorten, and the tracks will
   loop.  You will start over at track 1, but now the 3rd place time will be
   at a much lower time.  This is an excellent way to experience the old
   tracks with a little more challenge brought into the game.

10) This section will outline a few techniques to help you reach the finish
    line a little faster, thus improving your chances of qualifying for the
    next race.


a) Getting the bike parallel with the ground when in the air will maximize
   the distance in the air.  Useful for getting

b) If in doubt when taking a jump, just let the bike fly as it wants to.
   Often this will be a slower method of travel, but it will be an easier
   time landing.

c) Lining your bikes angle up with the slope of the landing area.  This will
   make your transition from obstacle to obstacle easier.

d) In Selection B, try to avoid getting stuck in a group of same speed
   opponents as they can pen you in.  This could be the difference between
   qualifying, and being eliminated.

e) When designing a course, try to mix some harder challenges with easier
   ones to create a fun course for all.
