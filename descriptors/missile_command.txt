2. HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Planet Zardon, a peaceful planet where the cities are free of crime, the 
resources are plenty, and everyone is always willing to put in their share of 
hard work in order to keep everything going smoothly.  It's a peaceful, happy 
planet.  Or was, untill Planet Krytol attacked.

The Krytolians were a group of evil aliens who foolishly squandered their own 
resources, and now having a barren planet devoid of life, they have launched an 
all-out attack on Zardon, in hopes of destroying all life on there and claiming 
the planet as their own.

Luckily, the Zardonians had constructed missile bases for just a situation like 
this one, armed with anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs.)  You are the only hope for 
Zardon, as you must commandeer the base and destroy the missiles that are being 
launched at the planet!


SETTING UP:

Set up your Atari 2600 or Atari 7800 and plug a joystick into the left 
controller socket.  If you are playing with a friend, plug a second joystick 
into the right controller socket.  Insert the game cartridge into your system 
and power up.

The difficulty switches affect the speed of your ABMs, with the left switch 
controlling the left player's ABMs, and the right switch controlling the right 
player's ABMs.  When set to the A (left position,) the cursor will be launched 
at a slow rate of speed.  When set to B, ABMs will launch at a faster rate.  To 
give an advantage to a player who is less skilled than the other, the skilled 
player should set their switch to A, and have the less skilled player have 
their switch set to B.

The TV Type switch is used if you are playing on a color TV or if you want the 
game to be played in black and white (for older TVs that only show up in black 
and white.)

Missile Command has 34 game variations, with 17 different gameplay types for 
one or two players.  Variations 1-17 are for one player, and variations 18-34 
are for two players.  The first number is the variation number, and the second 
indicates the number of players.  To quickly select a variation, hold down the 
Game Reset switch and press the Game Select switch repeatedly untill you find 
the variation you wish to play.  The different variations are listed below as

Children's Game
Basically, this variation has a slow cursor, dumb cruise missiles, and the 
enemy attacks are slow and have less missiles than other variations.  This is a 
good variation for young children to practice with.

See below for information regarding the cursor and cruise missiles.

When you are happy with the variation you have chosen, press the Game Reset 
switch to begin.


DEFENDING THE PLANET:

Make sure to hold the joystick with the button in the upper-left corner, facing 
toward the television screen.

When the game starts, you will see your cursor, a flashing rectangle, in the 
center of the screen.  Your base is the mound in the center of the surface with 
a flashing dot on top of it.  The dots underneath it indicate how many ABMS are 
currently stockpiled, a maximum of ten at one time.  You also have two extra 
ABM supplies on hand for when your first supply is gone, making for a total of 
thirty ABMs per wave.  If you use all thirty up in a single wave, you are 
defenseless untill the end of the wave.

There are six cities, three on either side of your base, with the citizens 
praying that you can defend them.  When you hear the air raid siren, it's time 
to get going!

Use the joystick to move your cursor around the screen.  Press the button to 
fire an ABM at the location indicated by the cursor.  When it reaches its 
destination, it will automatically explode.  You can have a total of up to 
three ABMs launched at one time.  If you try to launch more, you will hear a 
beeping noise, meaning that you must wait untill the explosion from the first 
missile disappears completely.

There are two types of missiles that you must defend your cities from:

Interplanetary Ballistic Missiles (IBM): The IBMs are the primary threat to 
your planet.  They appear as lines with flashing dots heading toward the planet 
surface.  If you do not destroy them, they will destroy your cities.  In order 
to destroy one, you must deploy an ABM so that the actual missile (the flashing 
dot) will be caught in the ensuing explosion from the ABM.  The best way to do 
this is to look at the path of the missile and fire an ABM so that it will 
detonate in the path of the IBM.

Cruise Missiles: Cruise Missiles will be launched after the sixth wave.  These 
are rectangle shaped (like the cursor, except they don't flash) and are 
deployed toward the planet surface.  You will hear a high pitched noise when a 
cruise missile is launched.  Like IBMs, Cruise Missiles must also be destroyed 
by an ABM.  However, Smart Cruise Missiles can easily evade the explosions of 
ABMs, making them harder to destroy, while Dumb Cruise Missiles simply fall in 
a straight line and can be destroyed easier.

If a missile hits a city, it will be destroyed instantly.  If your base is
hit, all loaded ABMs will be lost instantly.  If you have extra supplies, 
though, they will automatically be loaded into your base.

3. SCORING INFORMATION

Points are awarded for the following:

Destroy IBM: 25 Points
Destroy Cruise Missile: 125 Points
Unused ABM Bonus (at end of wave): 5 Points per Missile
Saved City Bonus (at end of wave): 100 Points per City

After the first two waves, the scoring multiplier is increased, and continues 
to increase as follows:

Waves 3-4: Double Point Value
Waves 5-6: Triple Point Value
Waves 7-8: Four Times Normal Point Value
Waves 9-10: Five Times Normal Point Value
Wave 11 and all Waves after: Six Times Normal Point Value

For every 10,000 points earned, a bonus city will be awarded, meaning that
one destroyed city (chosen at random) will be rebuilt.  A short tune will
play at the end of the wave to indicate that the bonus has been awarded.
If all six cities are still standing, the bonus city will be kept in stock
untill the end of a wave where at least one city was destroyed.  Even if
all six cities are destroyed, if you have at least one bonus city (either
earned during that round or in stock,) you can continue playing.

If all six cities are destroyed and you have no bonus cities remaining, the 
game is over.

4. TIPS

-In the early gameplay waves, when the IBMs are moving at a slow rate of speed, 
it's possible to place the cursor atop the missiles and fire ABMs to destroy 
them.  Later on, though, your best bet is to launch them into the path of an 
incoming IBM.

-If an IBM or cruise missile hits the planet surface, no damage will be done.  
In order for your base to sustain damage, the very top part of it must be hit 
(where the flashing dot is.)

-If you can tell an IBM or Cruise Missile is heading for the remains of a city, 
don't worry about destroying it, and focus on the other attacks instead.  
You'll save more ABMs and give yourself less stress this way.

-Since you can fire up to three ABMs at a time, don't sit around idly waiting 
for the explosion of the first one before moving to another location.  Instead, 
when you hear the sound of the missile being launched, move to the next spot 
you intend to fire at.

-Smart Cruise Missiles are tough, but they have one design flaw.  If you launch 
an ABM at them with the cursor directly atop it, they won't be able to detect 
the ABM, meaning they can be taken out without them evading the explosion of 
the ABM.

-And no matter how harried the battle gets, HAVE FUN!
