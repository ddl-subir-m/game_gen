How to play:
````````````

Each level has six missions. The object of the game is to defeat every enemy
in a mission and advance to the next one. Each level has prisoners that need
to be rescued. If you finish the Prison Camp without any rescued prisoners,
the game ends.

The levels are the same over and over again, but differ in difficulty such as
enemy speed and accuracy.

Getting hit by an enemy unit reduces your health bar. Collect health boosts to
stay alive, and kill enemies quickly before they get the chance to shoot you.
You get one continue per mission, but not in the Prison Camp or Airport area.

You only have limited amounts of ammo. There are also boosts you can shoot to
fill your supply. If you run out of machine gun ammo it will slowly count up
to 1 to give you the chance to shoot another ammo supply icon. The ammo count
is held over from mission to mission but you do get a full supply after the
ammo dump mission. You start the game with 7 Magazines and 5 Grenades.

Do NOT shoot the children, nurses or prisoners that come across the screen.
You lose parts of your health bar if you do so.

You rescue prisoners in the Prison Camp and Airport missions. They are
automatically rescued when they safely walk across the screen from right to
left but they can still die when they say "Thank You!". Knife Soliders will
hunt them down so take them out first.

Strategies:
```````````

When there are no nurses/children/prisoners around, shot the dynamite lying on
the ground as they can take out a bunch of enemies at once.

Do not fire randomly or keep firing all the time. Ammo is scarce. Watch your
ammo meter, shooting icons regurarly is a must. You never know when there is
a helicopter around the corner.

Don't be silly and shoot civilians.

Prioritize the enemies on screen. Go for the knife soliders first, enemies 
about to throw a grenade and also take care of helicopters, cars or boats
quickly.

There are more foot soldiers than the number indicates, but you only need the
required amount. This means that not taking out the armored units regularly
will lengthen the scene with more soldiers coming on-screen.

Prisoners walk across the screen from left to right. There is always a Knife
Soldier after them. Sometimes close behind, sometimes very far behind. Kill
them fast.
