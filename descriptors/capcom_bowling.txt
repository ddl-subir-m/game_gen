Capcom Bowling hit the Arcades in 1988.  I would tell you if it was a smash
hit, or just another sorry arcade attempt, but unfortunately, I was only one
year old in 1988.  I think it is a great game to play when you just want to go
back in time, and leave all the 3-D games alone.

I would have never known this game existed if it wasn't for a neat little
invention for computers called MAME.  MAME allows you to play old arcade
games.  The great thing about it is you don't have to waste your quarters.

Once I downloaded this game for MAME, I decided to write a basic FAQ for it,
so here it is.  Thanks for choosing my FAQ!  I hope this will help you out!

If you press the joystick upwards, you will roll the bowling ball.

       Button 1
    --------------

If you look in the upper-left corner of the screen in the game, you will
notice a "hook" meter.  By pressing button one, it causes the "hook" meter
to move to the left.  This causing the ball to curve to the left once it has
been rolled.  The higher the number, the sharper the turn in the roll.

   The Scoring System
------------------------

   - Every pin you knock down counts as one point.  For example, on your first
     roll of a set, you knock down 7 pins.  Then on the second roll of the
     set, you knock down two of the remaining three pins.  Your score for that
     set will be 9.

   - Knowing how the scoring system works for a spare is confusing until you
     learn how it goes.  If you get a spare, you automatically get 10 points,
     but you also get the amount of pins you knock down on your next roll
     added to the 10 points.  Let's say that on the 5th set you get a spare.
     Then on your 6th set you knock down 9 of the 10 pins.  This means that
     your score for the 5th set will be a 19.  The highest score possible for
     a spare is 20.  To get a 20, you must roll a strike after you roll the
     spare.

   - The scoring for a strike isn't as difficult as many people think.  If
     you roll a strike, you get 10 points tacked on automatically.  Then, you
     get the combined score of your next two rolls added to the 10 points.  An
     example is you roll a strike on the 3rd set.  Then on the 4th set, you
     roll yet another strike.  But when you get to the fifth set, you only
     knock down five pins on the first roll of the set.  When calculated, your
     score for set number 3 is 25.  The highest possible score for a strike is
     30.  To get a 30, you will need to roll three strikes in a roll, also
     known as turkey.

-------------------------------------------------------
   There are a couple of ways to get an easy strike.
-------------------------------------------------------

             ------------
                Way #1
             ------------

   - The first way is to keep your hook set at "0."  Once you are sure it is
     sat at "0," align your bowling ball in between the two middle "." marks,
     which is aligning with the middle "1"

     Once all of that is done, press and hold down forwards on your joystick.
     This usuaslly causes you to roll a strike.

             ------------
                Way #2
             ------------

   - The second way just looks prettier than the first.  Set your hook to one.
     If you sat the hook to the one on the right, then align your ball in the
     middle of the 2nd and 3rd "." marks from the left.  If you sat the hook
     to the one on the left, align your ball in the middle of the 4th and 5th
     "." marks from the left, or in other words, the 2nd and 3rd from the
     right.

     After everything is aligned like I told you to above, press and continue
     to hold forwards on the joystick.

   Getting the Spare
-----------------------

             --------------------------
                An easy to get Spare
             --------------------------

   - Some spares are easily gotten.  Such as when you have 2-3 pins closely
     gathered, or when you have just one pin.  If you have three pins left
     to knock down that are in a close formation, aim for the middle of the
     three pins.  This will cause the middle pin to spin and hit the other two
     pins.  That is if you hit the middle pin.

  -  When there are two pins that are close to each other, just aim in
     between each pin.  The bowling ball will slightly knick each pin, but it
     shall hit with enough force to knock the pins down.

   - It should be common sense on how to knock down one pin, if there is only
     one pin remaining.  However, for those of you that don't know, just align
     your bowling ball up with the pin.  Then roll the ball straight towards
     the pin.

             ----------------
                7-10 Split
             ----------------

   - The 7-10 split takes a lot of skills to master.  Out of all the possible
     setups of bowling pins, this is the hardest setup to knock down.  If you
     ever have a 7-10 split, align your ball at the edge of one of the
     gutters.  Now, adjust your hook to the opposite side.  For example, if
     you align the bowling ball on the right side, then adjust your hook to
     the left.

   - After all of the aligning is done, roll the bowl has hard as you can, and
     hope that you get the 7 pin and 10 pin down.
