BACKGROUND

It  is  the  year  1999.    Unidentified  Flying Objects (UFOs) have started
appearing with disturbing regularity in the night skies.  Reports of violent
human  abductions  and  horrific  experimentation has struck terror into the
hearts  of  millions.  Mass public hysteria has only served to expose Earths
impotence against a vastly superior technology.

Many  countries  have  attempted  to deal independantly with the aliens.  In
August  1998,  Japan  established an anti alien combat force, the Kiryu Kai.
Equipped  with Japanese made fighter aircraft the Kiryu Kai certainly looked
like  a powerful force.  However after 5 months of expensive operations they
had  yet  to  intercept  their  first UFO.  The lesson was clear: this was a
worldwide problem which could not be dealt with by individual countries.

On  December  11th  1998, representatives from the world's most economically
powerful  countries  gathered  secretly  in  Geneva.   After much debate the
decision  was  made  to  establish  a  covert  independant  body  to combat,
investigate  and  defeat  the  alien  threat.    this  organisation would be
equipped with the world's finest pilots, soldiers, scientists and engineers,
working together as one multi national force.

This organisation was named the Extraterrestrial Combat unit: XCOM

THE GAME

UFO  Enemy  Unknown  puts  you  in  command  of  XCom, with the finest Earth
technology  at  your  disposal  to  defend  the  Earth  from alien invasion.
Shooting  down UFOs is just the beginning.  You will then control a squad of
heavily  armed  soldiers,  edging  cautiously  through  the  local  terrain,
battling aliens and recovering UFO technology.

When  you  command  a  ground  assault,  you  will  use  the  3-D  isometric
'Battlescape'  display.  This shows terrain, buildings, XCom craft and UFOs,
but will only display what your soldiers can see so beware of danger lurking
around corners or down dark corridors!
 
Successful  ground  assault  missions mean that XCom scientists can research
alien  technology.   Engineers can then reproduce their superior weapons and
spacecraft.  Soon you will be fighting the aliens with their own technology.

As  the  game  progresses, you will use the on line 'UFOpaedia' to learn the
latest  details  from your research teams about alien technology, life forms
and  their  real  objectives.  Above all, you must watch the world political
situation.   Look out for governments who may be forced to make secret pacts
with  the  aliens  and  make  sure  you  defend  the countries who fund XCom
heavily.

UFO Enemy Unknown.  Command Earth's forces against the alien terror!
 
THIS MANUAL

This Manual is split into two main sections; 

Section  1: The Gameplay Tutorials are designed to get you playing UFO Enemy
Unknown as quickly as possible.  You are recommended to follow each tutorial
before you start to play the game on your own.

Section  2:  The  Reference Guide is intended for the player who is familiar
with  how to play UFO Enemy Unknown and needs to learn more about particular
game features.
 
The Controls 

You  will require a Mouse to play UFO Enemy Unknown.  This manual will refer
to  'clicking'  on  buttons,  icons or highlighted text.  To do this, simply
move the cursor over the option and press the Left Mouse Button (LMB).
 
SORTING THE MATERIALS

Your  UFO Enemy Unknown package contains this Manual, a Technical Supplement
and a set of disks to run the game.

SECTION 1 - THE GAMEPLAY TUTORIALS
----------------------------------

BEFORE WE BEGIN... 

Welcome  to  UFO  Enemy  Unknown.   These tutorials are designed to help you
start  playing  with the minimum of trouble.  The three main sections of the
game are covered here; the Geoscape, the Battlescape and the Bases Screen.

For  extra  information on particular game features, see the Reference Guide
section of the manual.

First of all, we will start a new game.

Starting a New Game

1.    Install  and  Load  UFO  Enemy  Unknown by referring to your Technical
      supplement.

2.    After  the  animated  introduction,  you  will  be  taken  to the Copy
      Protection Screen.

Type  in the from the manual reference given.  You will be taken to the game
options screen.

3.    Move  the mouse pointer over the New Game option and click on the Left
      Mouse  Button  (LMB)  to  select.  You will now be taken to the Select
      Difficulty Level screen.

4.    Move the mouse pointer over the Beginner option and click on the LMB to
      select.    You  will  now  be  taken  into  the  main game screen, the
      Geoscape.   The first thing you must do is to position your first XCom
      base on the surface of the Earth.

Setting-Up a New XCom Base

5.    The  message  Select  Site  for New Base will appear in the top of the
      screen.

In  the  bottom  right  hand  side  of  the screen, you will see three green
spheres  surrounded  by arrows.  These are the view controls which allow you
to rotate and magnify the display of the Earth.

Click  on  the  up  arrow  icon.   The Earth display will be magnified, some
borders around countries will appear.

6.   Click again on the up arrow icon.  The Earth display will be magnified
     again, some country names will now appear.

7.   Click  twice on the down arrow icon.  The Earth display will return to
     its minimum magnification.

8.   The  four  arrow icon allows you to rotate the Earth display up, down,
     left, or right.

Click a few times on the up arrow, The Earth display will tilt towards you

9.   Click a few times on the left arrow, the Earth display will rotate.

10.  Position the Mouse pointer over the Earth and click on the Right Mouse
     Button to centre the Geoscape on that location.

By  using  a  combination  of  these  controls, you can manipulate the Earth
display to show any part of the Earth in detail.

Note.  It is a good idea to position your base in the middle of a large land
mass such as North or South America, Russia or Europe.  This will give , you
a better chance of defending that area from UFO raids.

12.  A window containing the prompt Base Name?  will appear Type in a name
     using the Keyboard and press the Return Key.  You have now set up a new
     XCom base and you are ready to start playing UFO Enemy Unknown.

TUTORIAL 1: THE GEOSCAPE
------------------------

Tutorial  1  guides you through the Geoscapes basic controls and the process
of intercepting UFOs. 

1.  The Geoscape is the main screen for playing UFO Enemy Unknown.  You will
    see your base on the 3-D view of the Earth, represented as a hollow blue
    square.

On  the  right-hand  side  of  the screen, there is a list of Menu Options a
display of the Game Time, the Time Controls and the View Controls.

The  Time Controls are very important to the game, and it is these which we
will go through next.

Note:  If  you  wish  to pause the time at any stage during the game, simply
click on any of the menu options.

The Time Controls 
 
2.    Look  at  the Game Time.  You will see that it is passing by with five
second  jumps.   The Time Controls below the Game Time, allow you to control
the rate at which this time passes.

Click  on  the 5 Mins button.  The button will depress and time will pass at
an  increased  rate.    You will see the Game Time (above the Time Controls)
change  rapidly  and  night  and  day  will  be visible on the Earth, slowly
changing.

You  should  use  the  Time  Controls  to  advance the game through any time
consuming  section  of  the  game (eg.  waiting for craft to arrive at their
destinations or waiting for UFOs to be detected)

Detecting UFOs 

3.    We will now advance time to the point when XCom detect their first UFO
      (if this has not already happened.

Click on the 1 Day button in the Time Controls.  The button will depress and
time will pass at the maximum rate.

4.    Eventually,  a  window  will appear over the Geoscape with the message
      UFO-1 Detected.  data regarding the UFO is shown in this window.

Click  on the button marked Centre on UFO-Time=5 Secs.  This will centre the
Earth  display  on the UFO and reduce the passage of time to 5 seconds.  The
UFO will appear as a red cross in the centre of the Geoscape, moving slowly.

Intercepting UFOs 

5.   Position the Mouse pointer on your base and click on the LMB.  a window
     will  appear  with  the  title  Launch  Interception  and a list of the
     available craft at the base.
 
6.   Move the Mouse pointer to highlight Interceptor 2 and click on the LMB.

7.   The message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen.

Click  on  the  UFO  (represented  as  a  red  cross)  to select this as the
Interceptors target.

8.   The confirmation message Target: UFO-1 will appear.

Click on the OK button.

9.   The  Interceptor  (represented by a yellow cross) will launch from its
     underground base and attempt to intercept the UFO.

Note:  remember, if you need to pause the game, click on any of the Geoscape
Menu Options.

If  the  UFO  lands,  it  will appear as a green cross.  Interceptors cannot
carry out ground attacks; so you will have to wait until the UFO lifts off -
click on 5 Mins Time Control Button to accelerate the passage of time.

10.  At this point, one of two things could happen:-

A.  If your Interceptor catches the UFO, the Air-to-Air Combat window will
    appear.    Skip  the  rest  of  this  section  and go to step 19 of this
    tutorial.

B.  If  your  Interceptor  loses  contact  with  the UFO, the window UFO-1
    Tracking  Lost  will  appear.   This may happen several times before you
    actually get into combat; most UFOs can outperform your Interceptors.

Click on the OK button. Continue to the next step of this tutorial.
 
11. The Craft Status window will now appear, allowing you to redirect the
    Interceptor.

12. Click on the Go To Last Known UFO Position button.
 
13. While the Interceptor is on its way to the last known UFO position, it
    uses its on-board radar to scan for the UFO.

If  the  UFO-1  Detected  window  reappears,  go straight to step 14 of this
tutorial.

If  the  Interceptor reaches the last known UFO position without re-aquiring
the UFO, the following window will appear:-

If  this  happens,  the  UFO has disappeared from all XCom tracking devices.
The interception mission has failed.

Click on the Redirect Craft button.  The Craft Status window will re-appear.
Click on Return to Base.  The Interceptor will return to its base.

Go back to step 3 of this tutorial.

14.  Click  on  the  Centre  on  UFO-Time=5 Secs button in the UFO-1 Detected
     window.

15.  At the moment, the Interceptor is still heading for the last reported
     position  of the UFO.  Now we'll re-assign the UFO as the Interceptor's
     target.

Click on the Interceptor.  This will bring up the Craft Status window.
 
16.  Click on the Select New Target button.

17.  The message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen.
 
Click on the UFO to re-select it as the target.

18.  The message Target: UFO-1 will re-appear.

Click on the OK button.

Go back to step 10 of this tutorial.


Air-to-Air Combat 

19.  If  the  Interceptor  gets within range of the UFO, the Geoscape will
     automatically  increase  in  magnification  and  the  Air-to-Air Combat
     window will appear over the centre of the Geoscape.

20.  UFOs should not be shot down over water because you will not be able to
     examine the wreckage.

Click on the minimise window (large & small rectangles) icon in the top left
of the Air-to-Air Combat window.  The craft icon will appear in the top left
of the screen.

Check that the UFO is over dry land.  If it is over the sea, you can use the
1 Min Time Control to accelerate the passage of time.

21.  Click on the craft icon when the UFO is over the land.  This will bring
     back the Air-to Air Combat window, ready for you to attack the UFO.

22.  Click on the (.<) icon to carry out a Standard Attack on the UFO.  You
     will  see  the  progress  of the attack on the radar screen in the left
     hand  side  of  the  Air-to-Air  Combat window.  The message box in the
     bottom of the window relays the pilot's messages to you

If the UFO out runs the Interceptor, return to step 10 of this tutorial.

If  the  Interceptor  destroys  the UFO, you have failed in your objectives;
there  is  no  useful  debris  to  investigate.    Return  to step 3 of this
tutorial.
 
If  the  UFO  crash  lands, you have succeeded in your objectives; the crash
site  is  marked  with a white cross.  The UFO is now vulnerable to a ground
assault, allowing you to recover the wreckage.

Saving the Game

23.  Now would be a good time to save your current game.

Click on the Options button.

24.  Click on the Save Game button.

25.  The Select Save Position screen will appear.

Click  on any of the ten numbered buttons to select the slot into which your
current game will be saved.

26.  Type  in  a name for your saved game using the Keyboard and press the
     Return Key.
 
When the game has saved, you will be returned to the Geoscape.

Investigating the Crash Site. 

27.  You  will  need  to  assign  a Skyranger transport to take a squad of
     soldiers from your base to the Crash Site.

Find  your base (you may need to rotate the Geoscape to bring it into view).
Click on your base: the Launch Interception window will appear.
 
28.  Move the Mouse pointer to highlight Skyranger-1 and click.

29.  The  message Select Destination appears in the top of the screen.  . 

30.  Click on the UFO Crash Site (the white cross) to the Skyrangers target.

31.  The message Target: Crash Site-1 will appear.

Click on the OK button.
 
32.  The Skyranger (represented by a yellow cross) will launch and make its
     way to the UFO Crash Site.)

Click on the 5 mins button if you want to increase the passage of time.

33.  When  the Skyranger arrives at the Crash Site, the UFO Crash Recovery
     screen will appear.  Read the instructions on this screen.

Click  on  the OK button to enter the next section of UFO Enemy Unknown; the
Battlescape.

TUTORIAL 2: THE BATTLESCAPE
---------------------------

Tutorial  2  guides you through the close combat Battlescape; the section of
the game where you fight the aliens face to face.

Arming Your Squad

1.  The eight members of your squad automatically arm thejmselves with guns,
    ammunition  and  grenades.   The initial screen allows you to adjust the
    weapons your squad will carry into action.

Click  on  the left/right arrows in the top right of the screen to check the
armament of each of the eight members of your squad.

2.  You will see that six of your soldiers have rifles, one has a pistol and
    one  has  a  heavy  cannon.    The  soldiers  carry extra ammunition and
    grenades on their belts.

Full  details  of this section of the game are given oin the Ground Assaults
chapter of this manual.

Click on the OK button to exit this screen.

3.  The 'turn' screen will appear.

Note:  All  Battlescape  action  is turn based.  This means it is like a 3-D
game of chess - you move your pieces, the aliens moves theirs!

Click the Left Mouse Button to continue.

The Battlescape

4.   You will now see your Skyranger on the ground with its rear door open. 
     The  aircraft's  cabin  roof  is  'peeled away' to reveal your squad of
     eight soldiers within.

The  bottom section of the screen contains a number of buttons and displays.
This section of the screen is known as the Control Bar.

Using the Split Level View

5.   The  Battlescape  is  built up of several levels.  These can be viewed
     individually  or  may  be  assembled  into  a   complete   3-D picture.
     Splitting  the  Battlescape  into levels allows you to see behind walls
     and inside buildinds or craft.

At  the  moment,  the Battlescape is set to normal setting - the Multi-level
View.    The  multi-level view hides everything above the currently selected
level, this is why the Skyranger appears to have no roof.

Click  on the diamond 1 button in the Control Bar.  The number on the button
will change to 2.

The  cabin  roof and wings of the Skyranger will appear.  Your soldiers will
now be hidden from view.  This is a Full View of the Battlescape.

6.   Click  again  on  the diamond 1 button.  The number on the button will
     change back to 1.  The Battlescape returns to the Multi-level View.

7.   When you are in any of these views, you may need to switch to the next
     level up or down.

Click on the Down arrow/ladder button.

8.   The display will change to show just the landing legs and tail ramp of
     the Skyranger.

9.   Click on the up arrow/ladder button.
 
The display will return to the original view, with your squad visible inside
the Skyranger

Selecting Soldiers

10.  You control your squad individually, selecting and moving each soldier
     in turn

Move  the  Mouse  pointer  over the Battlescape display.  A red 3-D box will
appear under the pointer.

11.  Move this box over any soldier.  The box will now flash yellow and red.

12.  Click  on  the  Left  Mouse Button.  A yellow arrow appears above the
     soldier's head to show that he/she is now selected.

13.  Move  the  Mouse  pointer over any other soldier in the Skyranger and
     click  to  select.   Watch the soldier's name (halfway down the Control
     Bar) change.

Moving Soldiers 

14.  Move the Mouse pointer over either of the soldiers at the rear of the
     Skyranger  and  click  to  select.   The yellow arrow appears above the
     soldier's head to show that he/she is now selected.

15.  Now,  move  the  Mouse pointer over the ground just behind and to the
     right of the Skyranger.

16.  Click the Left Mouse Button.

The  soldier will walk out of the Skyranger to the destination you have just
set.  The Battlescape automatically switches to the next level down, so that
the Skyranger now only appears as the ramp and a set of landing legs.
 
17.  Click on the up arrow/ladder button.
 
18.  Move  the  Mouse  pointer  over  the other soldier at the rear of the
     Skyranger and click to select. 

19.  Now move the Mouse pointer over the ground just behind and to the left
     of the Skyranger.

20.  Click the Left Mouse Button. 

The  soldier will walk out of the Skyranger to the destination you have set.

21.  We now have two soldiers deployed from the Skyranger.  You may notice
     that  the Battlescape displays a little more of the surrounding terrain
     now.    This  is  because  the  Battlescape  only shows what is in your
     squad's line of sight.

Move  the  3-D  box to a point near one of the landing legs and click on the
Right Mouse Button.

The  currently  selected  soldier  will  turn  round and face the Skyranger,
scanning  the  surrounding terrain in the process.  Any nearby black squares
will turn into terrain as the soldier looks at them.

22.  If you want to look around the Battlescape at the visible terrain, move
     the Mouse pointer to the very edge of the screen.  The view window will
     move in that direction.

Note:  you  must  take  the  Mouse pointer to the very bottom of the screen,
under the Control Bar, to move the view window downwards.

23.  Click on the man/four arrows button to re-centre the Battlescape on the
     currently selected soldier.

24.  Click on the two people button.  The next soldier in your squad will be
     selected.

This  is an alternative way of selecting soldiers, saving you from having to
search around the Battlescape for every soldier.

25.  Move  this soldier out of the Skyranger, in the same way as the other
     two.

26.  Select and move another soldier out of the skyranger.

27.  You now have four soldiers deployed from the Skyranger.  This is enough
     for the moment, the rest can remain on board as reinforcements.

The primary objective of this mission is to kill or stun the aliens.  A good
place  to  find  aliens is the crashed UFO itself, so we'll start the search
there.

The Map Screen

28.  Click  on  the  rectangle grid button to access the Map Screen.  This
     displavs  a map of the mission area, allowing you to see XCom and alien
     forces, XCom craft and UFOs.

29.  You  will  see  four  flashing yellow dots on the map; these are your
     soldiers.    If a UFO has been spotted, its hull appears as a pale grey
     line.

30.  The map only shows one level of the Battlescape at a time.

Click  on  the up/down arrows on the left-hand side of the screen to display
the next level up or down.

31.  Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape.

The Turn - Based System

32.  If you saw a UFO in the Map screen, start moving your soldiers towards
     it.  If not, continue moving your soldiers around the Battlescape until
     you find the UFO.

Eventually the message Not Enough Time Units! appears.

33.  This  means  that the selected soldier has moved as far as he/she can
     possibly  move  in this turn.  When all four of the soldiers have moved
     to this point, it is time to end your turn.
 
Click on the circle/ button to end the turn.

The  aliens  will  now  be given a turn to move.  They may open fire on your
squad - you are helpless until your next turn.

On screen prompts tell you when to click the LMB to begin your next turn.

Searching For the Aliens

34.  Continue moving your squad around the Battlescape

to go through doors, click inside the room

to go up stairs, click at the top of the stairs

You  will notice that the Battlescape has an edge beyond which everything is
black.  This is the edge of the map - aliens will not go into this area.

Seeing the Aliens

35.  If  one  of  your soldiers sees an alien, he/she will immediatly stop
     moving  and  a  red  flashing  square  will  appear in the right of the
     Battlescape screen, just above the Control Bar.

Click on the red flashing square to centre the Battlescape on the alien

36.  The alien can now be seen in the centre of the screen

Click on the grid rectangle button to access the Map Screen.

37.  Aliens will appear as blue flashing dots on this map, the white cross
     indicates where the map is centred.

Look  for  your  soldiers  on  the map - there might be soldiers in a better
position to fire than the soldier currently selected.

Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape

38.  If  you  want  to re-centre the Battlescape on the currently selected
     soldier, click on the direction arrows button in the Control bar.

Using Guns

39.  We will now use a weapon against the alien, before it gets the chance
     to  fire at us.  This is probably a long range shot, so a rifle will be
     required.

Click on the rifle (at the far right of the Control Bar).

40.  A window will appear, allowing you to choose from a number of shots.

Move the Mouse pointer over the Aimed Shot option and click.

41.  You  will now return to the Battlescape.  The cursor has changed to a
     targeting cross instead of the 3-D box.

Position the cross over the alien and click the Left Mouse Button.

42.  Now, one of four things could happen:

A.    The  message  No  Line of Fire!  appears.  This means that there is an
object  between your soldier and the alien.  You must move your soldier to a
different  position  or  select  another  soldier  before attempting to fire
again.

B.    The  message  Not  Enough  Time Units!  appears.  This means that your
soldier  does  not  have  enough  Time Units to complete the shot.  You must
either choose another type of shot, select another soldier or end your turn.

C.    The  soldier  fires a shot..  and misses.  This is unfortunate, but is
expected - initially your soldiers are all rookies.  You will find that your
soldiers become more accurate as they fight more battles.

D.    The  soldier  hits  the  alien  with the shot.  The aliens wear strong
armour, so it may take more than one hit to kill them.

Click on the Right Mouse Button to change the Mouse pointer from a targeting
Cross to the 3-D box, ready to move your soldier again

Using Grenades

43.   If an alien is using an object for cover, you may prefer to attack it
      with a Grenade.

Click  on the single man button to access the Equip Soldier screen.  This is
similar to the screen which you saw before entering the Battlescape

44.  Initially  every  soldier has one grenade (the round black object) in
     his/her belt.

Move the Mouse pointer over the grenade and click.

The word Grenade will appear below the Soldier's name

45.  Move the Grenade over the box marked Left Hand and click again

If  the  soldier  has  enough  Time Units, the Grenade will be placed in the
soldier's left hand.

If  the  soldier does not have enough Time Units, replace the grenade in the
belt and repeat the operation after the next turn.

46.   Click on the OK button to return to the Battlescape.

47.   You  will  now see the Grenade in the Item Box on the far left of the
      Control Bar.

Click on the Grenade.

48.  A window containing the options Prime Grenade or Throw will appear.

Click on Prime Grenade.

Note:  If  at  any stage your soldier runs out of Time Units, simply end the
turn  and  complete  the  priming/throwing  process  on  the next turn.  But
beware!    The Soldier may be killed during the aliens turn if he/she is not
in cover.

49.  The  Set  timer window will appear, allowing you to set the number of
     turns until the grenade detonates.

Click on the number 3.

You  will  now  return  to  the  Battlescape,  with a primed grenade in your
soldier's left hand

50.  You  now  have three turns to throw the grenade and get away from the
     blast area.

Click on the grenade again.

51.  The only option is Throw.

Click on throw.

52.  You  now  return  to  the  Battlescape.   The cursor has a throw icon
     superimposed over the 3-D box

Click on the location where you want to throw the grenade.

53.  One of three things will happen:-

A.   The soldier will throw the grenade.

B.   The  message  Out  of Range!  will appear.  This is because the target
     location  is  too  far away.  If this happens, choose a target location
     which is closer to your soldier.

C.   The  message  Unable  to throw here!  will appear.  This is because an
     object  is  obstructing  the throw.  If this happens choose a different
     target location.

Don't forget.  Once you have thrown the grenade, you've got just three turns
to clear the area!

Completing the Mission

54.  Continue  searching for aliens (go back to step 34 of this tutorial).
     When all aliens have been killed, the mission is over.

XCom  will then automatically recover the UFO's remains, alien artefacts and
alien corpses.

To  abort  the mission before the mission objectives are completed, click on
the plane button in the Control bar.

Abort mission will only save soldiers who have returned to the Skyranger - a
warning  message  will  appear if you attemnpt to take off without your full
squad.

Note:  Do  not allow the aliens to kill all of your squad - there will be no
one to fly the Skyranger back to base, and it will be lost.  If you are down
to your last soldier, abort the mission.

The Debriefing 

55.  At  the  end  of  the  ground  assault  mission,  you will be given a
     debriefing.    This  will  inform  you if your missicon objectives were
     achieved and lists the items recovered.

Click  on  the  OK button in the bottom left of this screen to return to the
Geoscape.

56.  You might want to save the game at this point (see step 23 of Tutorial
     1  for details of how to save games).  If you want to replay the ground
     assault load in your previously saved game.
 
TUTORIAL 3: BASES
-----------------

From  research  and  manufacture  to equipping craft and soldiers, the Bases

19.  Click on the button marked OK.

20.  You will return to the New Research Projects window.

Click on the OK button in the bottom of this window.

21.  You will now return to the Current Research screen.  You will see that
     you  have  10  scientists  assigned to researching Laser Weapons and 10
     scientists assigned to researching the Motion Scanner.  The progress in
     each  of these projects is unknown; the scientists have not yet started
     work.

Click on the OK button in the bottom-right of this screen.

22.  You will return to the Bases screen.

Another important function carried out in the Bases screen is the purchasing
of items or the recruiting of personnel.

Click on the button marked Purchase/Recruit.

Purchasing/Recruiting

23.  You will be taken to the Purchase/Hire Personnel screen.

We will now purchase some items and hire some extra soldiers.

Move  the Mouse pointer over the up arrow button in the Soldier line (at the
top of the list of items) and click once.

24.  You will see the number in the Quantity column change to 1.

Click  on  the  up  arrow  button until the message Not Enough Living Space!
appears.

Note:  The message Not Enough Living Space!  appears because you do not have
enough  Living Quarter facilities at your base to accommodate the soldiers. 
To  build  more Living Qnarters, click on the Build Facilities button in the
Bases  screen,  see  the Bases section of the Reference Guide of this manual
for full details.

25.  If you lost your Skyranger troop transport in the ground assault, you
     can replace it by clicking once on the up arrow button in the Skyranger
     line of this screen.

26.  Move  the  Mouse  pointer  down the list until you get to Tank/Rocket

button  in  the Bases screen - again, see the Bases section of the Reference
Guide of this manual for full details.

29.  Click on the down arrow button in the bottom-right of the screen.  The
     list  will  move down a little.  Continue clicking on this button until
     it disappears.  You have reached the bottom of the list.  The last item
     on  the  list is the Stun Rod.  This item allows your soldiers to knock
     aliens  out  instead  of  killing them, the alien can then be recovered
     alive and interrogated.

30.  Move  the  mouse  pointer over the Stun Rod up arrow button and click
     twice.

31.  If  you  lost  your Skyranger in the ground assault, you will need to
     equip  its  crew.    Carry out the same process as above to choose some
     weapons  from  the  list  -  don't forget ammunition if you buy guns or
     rocket launchers.

32.  You have now completed choosing what you want to buy.

Click  on  the  OK  button  in  the bottom-left of the screen to confirm the
purchase.

33.  You will return to the Bases screen.

Click  on  the  Geoscape button in the bottom-right of the Bases screen, you
will return to the Geoscape.

Waiting For Delivery

34.  It  will  take  several  days  for  all the items you purchased to be
     delivered.

Check the Game Time.

Click  on the 1 Day button in the Geoscape Time Controls and allow 3 days to
pass.  If a UFO is detected, intercept it (see step 4 of tutorial 1 for full
details).

35.   Several windows may appear as time passes.  For the moment, just click
      on the OK button to make them go away.  We'll worry about these later.

When 3 days have passed, click on the 5 Secs button.

36.  We will now return to the Bases screen and equip the Skyranger with all
     the items we have just purchased.

Click on the Bases button.

37.  Click on the Equip Craft button.

Equipping the Skyranger

38.  Use the Mouse to highlight and click on Skyranger-1.

39.  The Equip Craft screen for the Skyranger will appear.

You  will  see  the  soldiers  assigned to the Skyranger, next to the button
marked  Crew.    If you didn't lose any in the ground assault, there will be
eight soldier icons.

Click on the Crew button.

40.  The Select Squad screen will appear.

This  screen  displays  the  names  of  the  soldiers  who  are  assigned to
Skyranger-1.

Click  on any names which are shown in light blue.  This will assign them to
Skyranger 1.  The Craft column of this screen shows which craft the soldiers
are assigned to.

41.   When  all the soldier's names are shown in white, all the soldiers at
      the hase are assigned to Skyranger-1.

Click on the OK button in the bottom of this screen.

42.   You  will  return  to  the  Equip  Craft screen.  Now we'll load some
      equipment onto the Skyranger.

Click on the button marked Equipment.

43.  The Select Equipment screen will appear.

Move  the  Mouse  pointer  over  the  right  arrow button in the Tank/Rocket
Launcher line (at the top of the list) and click.

The  tank/rocket launcher is now loaded onto Skyranger-1.  The number in the
Stores  column  changes  to  1 from 0, and the name of the item changes from
light blue to white, indicating that it is on board.

44.  Use  the same process to load any other equipment of your choice onto
     the Skyranger.

45.  Click on the OK button in the bottom of the screen.

46.  You will return to the Equip Craft screen.

Click  on the OK button in the bottom of the Equip Craft screen to return to
the Interception Craft screen.

47.  Click on the OK button in the bottom of the Interception Craft screen
     to return to the Bases screen.

48.  Click on the Geoscape button in the bottom-right of the Bases screen. 
     You will return to the Geoscape.

Returning to the Geoscape 

49.  Click  on  the  1  Day button in the Geoscape Time Controls.  Soon, a
     message will appear on the Geoscape.  This may be one of the following:
 
UFO  Detected  - go to step 4 of tutorial 1 for details of intercepting UFOs
when  you investigate the crash site this time, your soldiers will be better
equipped.

Research  Completed  -  your  scientists have completed their research work.
You should allocate them to another project as soon as possible (see step 11
of this tutorial).
 
XCom  Project  Monthly  Report  - at the end of each month, the XCom Project
Monthly  Report  will  appear  to  inform  you  of your progess in the fight
against the aliens.  See the Geoscape section of the Reference Guide of this
manual for full details.

Other messages may appeal to inform you that a new purchase has arrived or a
manufacturing process has become available.

The End Of the Tutorial

Much  of  the  enjoyment of UFO Enemy Unknown is discovering new technology,
gathering  informnation  on  the  aliens  and  battling  through hundreds of
different landscapes.

These  tutorials have been a basic gnide to the way UFO Enemy Unknown plays.
There may be further game enhancements which are documented in the Technical
Supplement.    Use the Reference Guide section of this manual for details of
specific menu options or game features.

Playing Tips

To  succeed  in  the  war against the aliens, you will need to carry out the
following:-

Establish more bases around the world

Click  on the Build New Base button in the Bases screen.  Establish bases in
the  countries  who are funding you heavily - refer to the Graphs screen for
this information.

Build more facilities at your bases.

Click  on  the Build Facilities button in the Bases screen.  Experiment with
different  sized  bases  -  you  dont  always  have to build hangars.  Build
dedicated  'listening  posts',  equipped  with  both  large  and small radar
systems,  then  add hangars when you can afford them.  By using this tactic,
you will detect many more UFOs.

Develop a powerful squad

Don't allow your soldiers to be killed in the ground assaults, you will find
that  they  fight  better  when they are more experienced.  Equip your squad
with  the  best  weapons available and avoid exposing your soldiers to enemy
fire by keeping them in cover.

Plan your research carefully

Concentrate  research  on  developing alien based technologies and take care
that  your  scientists stay busy - research work costs relatively little and
the rewards are great.

Build new weapons and craft based on alien technology

If  your scientists have researched alien items, your engineers will be able
to reproduce them.  XCom will eventually be using the most advanced weaponry
on Earth, fighting the aliens with their own technology. 

SECTION 2: THE REFERENCE GUIDE
------------------------------

1. GAME OPTIONS

The  Game  Options  screen appears when you load UFO Enemy Unknown, allowing
you  to  select  between  New  Game  or Load Saved Game.  Position the Mouse
Pointer  over  the  required option and click the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to
select.

1.1 NEW GAME

If  you  select New Game in the Game Option screen, you will be taken to the
Select Difficulty Level screen.

This  allows  you to change the way the game plays to suit your skill level,
from level 1 (Beginner) to level 5 (Superhuman).  It is recommended that you
complete the game at one of the lower difficulty levels before attempting to
play the game at level 5.

The difficulty level affects :-

- the hostility and skill of aliens

- the aggression of UFOs

Pick a difficulty level by clicking on one of these five buttons.

You  will  now  be  taken  to the main game screen, the geoscape The message
Select Site For New Base will appear at the top of the screen

Click  on  any  part of the world to position your first XCom base.  Use the
Geoscape  controls  if  you want to rotate the display of the Earth (see the
section  of  this  manual  on  The  Geoscape  Screen for full details of the
Geoscape controls)

The  last New Game set-up is to name your first base.  The prompt Base Name?
will appear - type in your first bases name using the Keyboard and press the
Return Key.  You will now be able to use the Geoscape as normal.

1.2 LOAD SAVED GAME

If  you select Load Saved Game in the Game Options, you will be taken to the
Select Game To Load Screen.

The  name  of  the  saved game is displayed in the middle of the screen, the
game's time and date is also displayed.

Pick  a  saved  game  by clicking on one of the ten buttons on the left-hand
side  of  the  screen  and  click  the  LMB.    You will now be taken to the
Geoscape, at the point when the game was saved.

2. THE GEOSCAPE SCREEN.

The  Geoscape  Screen  is  the main screen for playing UFO Enemy Unknown; it
displays  the  latest  data  on alien activity and allows you to control and
monitor XCom interception craft.

The  Geoscape  screen  is  made  up  of  five  parts: the Geoscape, the View
Controls, the Time Controls, the Game Time and the Menu Options.

2.1 THE GEOSCAPE

The  Geoscape is a 3-D view of the Earth which may be rotated or magnified. 
At  minimum  magnification  it  displays  the whole planet, while at maximum
magnification  it  shows  detail  such as borders and cities.  Terrain types
from  desert  to  snowscape  are  represented  on the surface of each of the
continents, and night and day are fully simulated.

The Geoscape uses symbols to represent the following:-

Blue Box     -  an XCom base
Yellow +     -  an XCOm craft
Orange x     -  an XCom craft's destination (also known as a 'waypoint')
Red +        -  a UFO in the air.
Green x      -  a UFO on the ground
White x      -  a UFO crash site
Pink Box     -  an alien base
Pink +       -  an alien terror site

2.2  THE VIEW CONTROLS

The  view  Controls  allow  you  to  manipulate the view of the Earth in the
Geoscape.

Click on the up or dowu arrows to tilt the view of the Earth up or down.

Click  on  the  left  or right arrows to rotate the view of the Earth to the
left or right (about the Earths polar axis)

Click on the up arrow icon to increase the magnification of the Geoscape.

Click  on the down arrow icon to decrease the magnification of the Geoscape.

Click  on the Geoscape using the Right Mouse Button to centre the display on
that location.

2.3 THE TIME CONTROLS

The  Time  Controls allow you to adjust the rate at which time passes in the
game.

Time  may  be  accelerated  from  5  second stages to 1 minute, 5 minute, 30
minute, 1 hour and 1 day segments.  This means that you may cut out the long
periods  of  waiting for XCom radar to detect a UFO.  To select a particular
rate of time passage, click on any of the six Time Control Buttons.

The  passage  of time is suspended when any of the Geoscape Menu Options are
accessed.

2.4  THE GAME TIME

UFO  Enemy  Unknown  begins  at  12:00 pm on the 1st January 1999.  All game
times are given in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

2.4.1 THE XCOM PROJECT MONTHLY REPORT

At  the  end  of  each month, you will be given a report of your progress so
far.  This report is in the following form:-

Month - the month which has just ended.

Monthly  Rating - XCom's overall performance rating for the previous month. 
This takes into account the following:-

- success of interceptions

- scores for ground assault missions

- research work completed

- alien activity

A  plus  (  + ) sign before the figure indicates a good performance, a minus
(-) sign indicates a poor performance.

Funding  Change  - the difference between this months and last month's total
funding.    A  plus  (  +  ) sign before the figure indicates an increase in
funding, a minus (-) sign indicates a decrease in funding.

This  is  followed by a general report on how the Council of Funding Nations
views recent XCom anti alien operations.

Click on the OK button to exit this screen.

2.4.2 PSIONIC TRAINING

If  you  have built a Psi-Lab at any of your bases, you will be taken to the
Psionic Training screen each month, after the Monthly Report.

Psionic powers allow XCom soldiers to use mind control as a weapon.  The Psi
Amp  is  required  to convert the thoughts into psionic powers, without this
the soldier cannot use psionic skills as a weapon.

The  Psionic  Training  screen lists all XCom bases with a Psi Lab facility.
Psi Labs are essential to carry out psionic training.

Click on any of the Base Name buttons to Assign soldiers to Psionic Training
at that base.

2.4.2.1 Assign Soldiers to Psionic Training

This  screen  allows  you to assign individual soldiers to psionic training.
The  top of the screen shows the Remaining Psi-Lab Capacity.  This indicates
the nunmber of soldiers who may be assigned to Psionic Training.

Below this is a list of the following:-

Name - the soldier's name.

Psionic  Strength  -  this  is a measure of the soldier's natural ability to
defend  against  psionic  attack.   It never changes, regardless of how much
training the soldier goes through.

Psionic Skill/Improvement - this is the soldier's ability to use the Psi Amp
in  mental combat.  The soldier's mental combat ability is dependent on both
this and Psionic Strength.

Note:  it  is  better to concentrate your Psionic Training on soldier's with
high Psionic Strength.

In Training? - whether or not the soldier is in training.

Note: carrying out missions also improves a soldier's Psionic Skill.

Click on the OK button to return to the Psionic Training screen.

Click  on  another  Base  Name  button  to  assign more soldier's to Psionic
Training or click on the OK button to return to the Geoscape.

2.5 THE MENU OPTIONS

Click on the Menu Option buttons to access other screens and functions:

Intercept - allows you to give XCom craft orders to intercept UFOs.

Bases  -  takes  you  into  the  Bases screen (see the Bases section of this
manual for full details).

Graphs  -  takes  you into the Graphs screen (see the Graphs section of this
nmanual for full details).

UFOpaedia  - takes you into the UFOpaedia (see the UFOpaedia section of this
manual for full details).

Options - takes you into the Options screen (see the Options section of this
mannal for full details).

Funding  -  takes  you  into  the  International  Relations display (see the
Funding section of this manual for full details).

2.6 USING THE GEOSCAPE

XCom's  main  task  is  to  shoot  down  and investigate UFOs.  This ensures
coutinued  government  funding and allows XCom to learn more about the alien
threat.

When  there  is  no UFO activity, you will probably want to keep the rate of
time  passage  fairly high.  Click on the 1 hour button in the Geoscape Time
Controls.  Time will pass rapidly until you get a message informing you that
a UFO has been detected.

2.6.1 THE UFO DETECTED WINDOW

XCom bases automatically detect any UFOs within range of their radar.  Later
on  in  the  game,  you  will  be  able  to  research and manufacture better
detection and tracking systems, based on captured alien technology.

When  a  UFO  is  detected, time is paused and a window titled UFO- (number)
Detected  appears in the centre of the Geoscape display.  Every UFO detected
is  given  a  consecutive number, for example, the 41st UFO detected by XCom
will be named UFO-41.

The following data is also presented when a UFO is detected:-

Size     - the size of the UFO.

Altitude - the approximate height at which the UFO is flying.

Heading  - the general direction in which the UFO is travelling.

Speed    - the speed at which the UFO is travelling (in knots).

This window also gives you the option to either:-

Centre  on  UFO  -  Time = 5 Secs - centres the Geoscape display on the UFOs
current  position  and  reduces  the passage of time to 5 seconds.  Click on
this option if you intend to intercept the UFO. 
 
Cancel  -  hides the message window and leaves the Geoscape as it was before
the  UFO  was  detected.  Click on this option if you wish to take no action
against the UFO.

Note:  While  your  Interceptors  are  capable of a high maximum speed, UFOs
often  travel  faster.    A  UFO may unwittingly change course or slow down,
however, so it is good practice to attempt to intercept all UFOs detected.

2.6.2 THE LAUNCH INTERCEPTION WINDOW

To  assign  an XCom Interceptor to attack a UFO, you may either click on the
Interceptor's  base, or click on the Intercept Menu Option (in the top-right
of the Geoscape screen)

The  advantage of clicking on the Intercept Menu Option is that you may give
orders  to  an  Interceptor  which  is  based  on  the  opposite side of the
Geoscape,  hidden  from  view.  Simply clicking on a base only allows you to
assign craft from that base.

The Launch Interception window displays the following information:-

Craft  -  the  type  and  registration  number  of  the  craft (for example,
Skyranger  6  is  the  sixth craft to be operated by XCom and is a Skyranger
transport).

Status - this may be either: -

Ready - the craft is available for interception duty.

Refuelling - the craft is refuelling; this can take several hours.

Rearming - the craft is having its air-to-air weaponry changed.

Repairs - the craft is undergoing repair work.

Out - the craft is already carrying out an interception.

Base - the craft's home base.

If  you  wish  to  return  to the Geoscape without selecting an interception
craft, click on the Cancel button.

2.6.3 SELECTING AN INTERCEPTION CRAFT

Use  the Mouse to highlight an Interceptor from the Launch Interception list
and click to select this craft.

The  Select Destination window will now appear at the top of the screen.  If
you  wish to return to the Geoscape without selecting a target, click on the
Cancel button.

To  select a UFO as the interception target, simply click on its location on
the Geoscape.

The message Target: UFO-(number) will appear.

Click  on  the  OK  button to accept this UFO as the target, or click on the
Cancel button to select a different target.

The  interceptor will now launch from its underground base and take the most
direct path to the UFO.

2.6.4 THE CRAFT STATUS WINDOW

At any time when an XCom craft is airborne, click on it to display the Craft
Status window.  This contains the following information:-

Craft name - the type and registration nnmber of the craft.

Status - the orders which the craft is carrying out.

Base - the craft's home hase.

Speed - the current speed of the craft (in knots).

Maximum Speed - the craft's maximum speed (in knots).

Altitude - the craft's approximate height.

Fuel  -  the percentage of fuel remaining in the craft.  When fuel reaches a
critical level, the craft will automatically return to base.

Weapon-1  -  The  type of weapon loaded into weapon bay number 1 followed by
number of rounds of that weapon remaining.

Weapon-2  -  The  type of weapon loaded into weapon bay number 2 followed by
number of rounds of that weapon remaining.

The Craft Status Window also has four buttons, allowing you to:-

Return to Base - abort the interception and return to base.

Select New Target - abort the interception and select a new target.

Patrol - abort the interception and remain at the current position.

Cancel - return to the Geoscape without issuing any orders.

2.6.5 THE UFO STATUS WINDOW

At any time when a UFO is displayed on the Geoscape, click on it to bring up
the  UFO  Status window, repeating the information shown in the UFO Detected
window.

2.6.6 THE TRACKING LOST WINDOW

The message UFO- (number) Tracking Lost will appear if XCom tracking devices
lose contact with a UFO while it is being intercepted.

Click on the OK button.  The Craft Status window will appear, giving you the
option to either Return to Base, Patrol or Go to Last known UFO Position.

It  is  usually  best  to  go  to  the  last  known  UFO position, since the
interception  craft  may  be  able  to  re acquire the UFO with its on board
radar.

2.6.7 THE AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT WINDOW

When  the  XCom  craft  has  manoeuvred  within firing range of the UFO, the
Air-to-Air  Conmbat  window  will  appear.  The interception craft is now at
stand-off range, awaiting your orders.

Remember  that  you  are  setting out to cause the UFO to crash land, not to
blow it into a million pieces!

The Air-to-Air Combat window consists of the following:-

2.6.7.1 The Order Buttons

Click on the buttons in this display to carry out the following:-

Standoff - follow the UFO without firing at it.

Cautious Attack - attack the UFO from the maximum range of each weapon.

Standard Attack - move to the minimum range of each of the available weapons
and fire at the standard rate.

Aggressive  Attack  -  move  to  the  minimum range of each of the available
weapons and fire at the maximum rate.

Disengage - abort the interception and return to base.

View  UFO  -  replace  the  Air-to-Air combat window with a view of the UFO.
Click on the LMB to return to the Air-to-Air Combat window.

2.6.7.2 The Radar Screen

The  Interceptor  will use its on-board radar to carry out the attack on the
UFO.    The  Radar  Screen section of the Air-to-Air Combat Window shows the
Interceptor's  Radar Screen, allowing you to monitor the final stages of the
interception.

The  UF0  will  appear  as  a bright "blip" on the Radar Screen, the size of
which depends on the size of the UFO.

2.6.7.3 The Weapons Display

There  are  a  pair of icons either side of the Radar Screen which represent
what  is  fitted  to  the weapons bays of the Interceptor.  These icons each
have  a  number  under  them,  indicating the number of rounds of the weapon
which are remaining.

The  maximum  range  of  each of the weapons is also shown, in the form of a
line extending out of the weapon icon and onto the Radar Screen.  When a UFO
gets within this boundary, the Interceptor will open fire.

2.6.7.4 The Range to the UFO

The  range  to  the UFO is a simple digital readout of the distance from the
UFO to the Interceptor.

2.6.7.5 The Damage Display

The  damage display indicates the Interception Craft's current damage state.
The picture of the craft is filled in red as it receives damage.

2.6.7.6 The Minimise Window Icon

If you shoot the UFO down over water, the wreckage will be swept away before
anything  of value can be recovered.  The Minimise Window feature allows you
to  track the UFO on the Geoscape until it is over land, then shoot it down.

To carry this out, click on the double rectangle icon in the top-left of the
Air-to-  Air Combat window.  The Craft Icon (with a pictorial representation
of  the  craft  plus  its  XCom  registration number) will now appear in the
top-left of the Geoscape and time may be advanced or slowed as normal.

When  the  UFO  gets over the land, click on the Craft Icon.  The Air to Air
Combat window will now re-appear, ready for you to carry out your attack.

Note:  you  can also use the Minimise Window icon to give other Interception
Craft  orders to attack the UFO.  There can be up to four Interception Craft
attacking  a  UFO  simultaneously, maximising the chances of success against
the larger UFOs.

2.6.7.7 The Message Box

The  Message  Box  is  in  the  bottom  of  the Air-to-Air Combat window and
displays  messages  from the pilot of the nterceptor to you.  These messages
either confirm your orders or inform you of what the UFO is doing.

2.6.8 SHOOTING THE UFO DOWN

Click  on  the  Standard  Attack button.  The message UFO Crash Lands!  will
appear  if  you  successfully cause the UFO to crash land.  The display will
then  automatically  return  to  the full screen Geoscape with a white cross
marking the UFO Crash Site.

2.6.9 INVESTIGATING UFO CRASH SITES

The UFO is now vulnerable to ground assault, and you should send out an XCom
squad to investigate it and to recover any available alien technology.

Click on a base or use the intercept Menu Option to select a Skyranger troop
transport  craft (just as you did previously with the Interceptor and assign
the  UFO Crash Site as the target.  The Skyranger will now take-off and make
its way to the UFO Crash Site.

Note  :  Only  craft which contain soldiers or HWPs are allowed to intercept
Crash Sites or landed UFOs.

When the Skyranger arrives at the Crash Site, you are taken to the UFO Crash
Recovery screen

Click  on  the  OK  button  to  enter  the Equip Squad screen.  See the next
chapter of this manual for full details on Ground Assaults.

2.7 OTHER GEOSCAPE USES

As  well  as  controlling  the  interception  and investigation of UFOs, the
Geoscape  may  be used for several other functions Some of them are outlined
below; the others are for you to discover!

2.7.1 GROUND ASSAULTS ON UFOS

As  well as investigating crashed UFOs, you may send a troop transport craft
to  an  intact  UFO  which has landed.  This is dangerous for your soldiers,
however, and is not advised unless you have a very powerful squad.

2.7.2 TERROR SITES

The  aliens  will attempt to terrorise civilian populations as part of their
invasion  plans.    This  must be prevented at all costs: a successful alien
Terror Site in a funding country could cause its government to withdraw from
the XCom project.

2.7.3 ALIEN RAIDS ON XCOM BASES
 
As  the  ganme  progresses,  the aliens will carry out missions to find XCom
bases.   If the aliens discover the location of any of your bases, they will
attempt to destroy them with a ground assault.

2.7.4 ALIEN BASES

The  aliens  will attempt to build bases on the Earth.  These are used for a
variety  of purposes from operating UFOs to infiltrating governments.  Alien
bases  may  be  detected  by  sending an Interception Craft to the suspected
location  of  the base aud selecting the Patrol option.  You advised to raid
alien  bases  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  but make sure you have a very
powerful squad before you try!

3 GROUND ASSAULTS

Ground Assaults take place when XCom carry out any of the following:-

- Investigate crashed UFO sites

- Assault UFOs at their landing sites.

- Intervene at alien terror sites.

- Defend XCom bases against alien attack.

- Attack alien bases.

All  missions,  except  defending XCom bases, require you to use a transport
craft  to  get to your destination.  When you begin the game, the only troop
transport available is the Skyranger, but as the game progresses you will he
able to manufacture new craft.

3.1 THE EQUIP SQUAD SCREEN

Before  you  begin  a  Ground  Assault, you will be taken to the Equip Squad
screen.   Your soldiers will automatically pick up some weapons, but you may
wish to re-equip them.

The  top  left  of the Equip Squad screen contains the name of the currently
selected  soldier.   At the top-right of the screen are two arrows, allowing
you to select the next, or the previous soldier in your squad.

At  the centre of the screen is a soldier, who will be dressed in the armour
which  you  may  have  selected  in the Equip Craft screen.  This soldier is
surrounded  by  the locations in which weapons may be carried.  The items on
the ground may be picked up and carried by the soldier.

To  pick  up a item from the ground, simply move the Mouse over the item and
click.    The item will now be "attached" to the Mouse pointer.  The name of
this  item is shown in the top of the screen under the soldier's name.  Move
the  item  over  the  location  in which you want it to be carried and click
again.  The item will now be available for use by the soldier.

To  load  a  weapon with ammunition, pick up the ammunition and click on the
appropriate  weapon.    To carry this out, the weapon must be in a hand, the
right type and unloaded.

To  unload  ammunition from a weapon, pick up the loaded weapon and click on
the  Unload  button.  The weapon will go to the soldier's right hand and the
ammunition to the left.  To carry this out, both of the soldier's hands must
be empty.

When  you  have  finished equipping your soldiers, click on the OK button to
enter the main part of the Ground Assault; the Battlescape. 

3.2 THE BATTLESCAPE SCREEN 

The  Battlescape Screen is a 3-D display which allows you to control a small
squad of heavily armed XCom soldiers.

3.2.1 USING THE BATTLESCAPE

Your  squad start the mission in their transport craft.  The soldier nearest
to the craft's exit ramp has a yellow arrow to show that he/she is selected,
ready to move out.

3.2.1.1 Selecting and Moving Soldiers

A  3-D box will appear when you move the Mouse pointer over the Battlescape.
To select a different soldier, either click on the button in the Control Bar
(see  the  next  section  for  full  details of the Control Bar) or move the
cursor  box  over  the required soldier and click.  A yellow arrow indicates
the selected soldier.

To  move the selected soldier to a destination simply move the cursor box to
the destination and click.

To  make the selected soldier turn around without moving along, position the
cursor box in the direction you want the soldier to face and press the Right
Mouse Button.

3.2.1.2 Moving the View Window

Move  the  Mouse  pointer  to the edge of the screen to move the Battlescape
view window up, down, left or right.

Note: you must take the Mouse pointer to very bottom of the screen under the
Control Bar, to move the view window downwards.

You  will  notice that there is an edge to the Battlescape map, beyond which
everything  is  black;  this  is  a  region  into  which the aliens will not
venture.    Aliens  do  not stray far from their crashed UFO because Earth's
atmosphere is hostile to them.

3.2.1.3 Line of Sight

The  Battlescape will only display what is within your squads line of sight.
This means that you must seek out the aliens through dark, unexplored areas.

3.2.1.4 Using the Split Level View

The  Battlescape  is  built  up  of  several  levels.    These can be viewed
individually,  allowing  you  to  see  behind  walls and inside buildings or
craft.    Click  on  the  diamond  1  button on the Control Bar to break the
Battlescape into levels.

3.2.1.5 The Turn-Based System

The  Battlescape  operates  uuder a turn-based system.  This means that your
soldiers  will  he  able  to  move a certain distance before the message Not
Enough  Time  Units!    appears.    When  all  of your squad have used their
allocated  Time  Units,  click on the cancelled circle button on the Control
Bar  to  end  your  turn.  When the aliens have completed their moves, it is
your turn again.

The  Hidden  Movement  screen  will appear when the aliens are moving out of
sight of XCom soldiers.

However  there  is  an  exception  to the turn based rule.  If you move your
soldiers  directly  into  the  alien's  line  of fire, they will take a shot
during  your turn.  Similarly, your soldiers will automatically open fire if
the aliens move into your soldiers' line of fire during their turn.  See the
section of this manual on Opportunity Fire for full details. 

Note:  it is best to end your turn when your soldiers are in cover; close to
walls or behind large objects.

3.2.1.6 Seeing the Aliens

When one of your soldiers sees an alien, a pulsing red square will appear in
the bottom right of the Battlescape screen.

Click on the pulsing red square to centre the Battlescape on the alien

3.2.2  USING WEAPONS

When  you  can  see  an  alien  on  the Battlescape, you should use a weapon
against  it before it gets a chance to fire.  Click on one of the Item Boxes
on the left or right of the Control Bar to use a weapon.

A  window appears, giving you the option to select from a number of options.
These  will  vary,  depending  on the weapon Click on the required option to
carry out any of the following:-

Aimed  Shot  -  a  carefully  aimed  shot, requiring maximum effort from the
soldier and therefore maximum Time Units.
 
Snap  Shot  - an un-aimed shot in the target's general direction.  This type
of  shot  is  only  effective at extremely short range, or when using a very
powerful weapon (such as a rocket launcher).

Auto  Shot  -  a  three  shot burst of automatic fire in the targets general
direction.  This type of shot can be very effective, especially when used at
Short range.  Not all weapons are capable of automatic fire, however.

Prime  Grenade  -  set the timer on a grenade or explosive charge.  When you
click  on  this option, a window appears with numbers from 0 to 23.  This is
the number of turns it will take before the grenade detonates.  Click on the
required number and either put the grenade down or throw it.

Note:  proximity  grenade's  do  not  have  a  timer, but will detonate when
anything  (including  your  soldiers)  moves nearby.  These should always be
thrown to prevent the risk of detonation.

Hit  - strike your opponent with the weapon/object.  To do this your soldier
must be standing next to the opponent.

Throw  -  throw  the  Weapon/Object.  This option is mainly intended for use
with grenades or explosives.

3.2.2.1  Maximising Your Fire Potential

As  well  as  the  soldier's  ability  and the type of shot fired, there are
several other factors which determine the accuracy of a shot:-

Accuracy is increased if the soldier is kneeling.

Accuracy  is  decreased if the soldier is wounded or if a two- handed weapon
(such  as a rifle or rocket lauucher) is being fired while the other hand is
not free.

3.2.3  THE BATTLESCAPE CONTROL BAR 

3.2.3.1  The Item Boxes

To  the  extreme  left  and  right  of  the  control  bar are the Item Boxes
containing  a  picture  of  the items held in the soldier's hands.  Click on
these boxes to use a Weapon/object.

3.2.3.2  Ascend/Descend Controls: Up/Down

Click  on either of these buttons to move soldiers up or down between levels
when  they are either standing on a gravlift or if the soldier is capable of
flight.

3.2.3.3  View Next Level Up/Down

Click  on either of these buttons to view the next level up or down from the
level which is currently displayed.

3.2.3.4 Map Screen
 
Click  on  this  button to view a map of the mission area.  To re-centre the
map  on  another  part  of  the  mission  area,  simply click on the desired
position.   The white cross in the centre of the screen shows where both the
map and the Battlescape are centred.
 
The  map will only display one level of the Battlescape at a time.  Click on
the  up  or  down  arrows  on the left-hand side of the map to view the next
level up or down.

The map uses symhols to represent the following:-

Yellow dots   - XCom forces

Blue dots     - alien forces

Red dots      - civilians

White Crosses - dead aliens or humans

Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape Screen.

3.2.3.5 Stand/Kneel

Click  on  this  button  to  make  the selected soldier stand or kneel.  The
advantage of kneeling is that your soldier is less visible to the aliens and
fires more accurately.

3.2.3.6 Equip Soldier Screen

Click on this button to view the equipment carried on the selected soldier's
body or on the ground at the soldiers feet.

This  display  is  similar to the Equip Squad screen at the beginning of the
Ground Assault.  The only difference is that the top right of the screen now
displays the soldier's remaining Time Units.

Moving  weapons and equipment from one location to another uses Time Units. 
The  amount  of  Time Units required to move an object is dependent on where
the  item is - removing items from a backpack takes more effort than putting
an item on the ground.

Click on the OK button to return to the Battlescape screen

3.2.3.7 Centre Display on Soldier

Click  on  this  button  to centre the Battlescape on the currently selected
soldier's level and location.

3.2.3.8 Select Next Soldier

Click  on  this  button  to  select  and  centre the Battlescape on the next
soldier in your squad. 

3.2.3.9 Select Next Soldier - Deselect Current Soldier

Click  on  this  button  to  select  and  centre the Battlescape on the next
soldier  in  your squad.  The soldier currently selected will be de-selected
so  next  time  you click on the icon the soldier will not appear.  Use this
button when you are happy with the position of a particular soldier.

3.2.3.10 Split Level View

Click  on  this  button  to  change  how  the  levels of the Battlescape are
displayed.  The number on the button will change to indicate:-
 
1  -  Multi  level  View  -  everything  from  the  currently selected level
downwards is displayed.

2  -  Full  View  -  every  level  is displayed, regardless of what level is
selected.    Selecting  this  will  hide any of your soldiers who are behind
walls and inside buildings or craft.

3.2.3.11 Options

Click on this button to call up the Battlescape Options screen.  This allows
you  to  select  different speeds for animations and scrolling, depending on
player preference and the processing speed of your computer.

3.2.3.12 End Turn

Click on this button to end your turn.

3.2.3.13 Dust Off

Click on this icon to abort the mission.  Only soldiers aboard the transport
craft will be saved.

Note:  if you abort an alien base raid, only soldiers in the rooms where you
are initially deployed are saved.  Aborting the mission during an alien raid
of an XCom base concedes defeat to the aliens.

3.2.3.14 Reserve Time Units

When  your soldiers move, they use Time Units which might be needed to use a
weapon.  These buttons allow you to reserve Time Units for using weapons:

- click on the top left button to carry out free movement with no limitation

-  click  on  the  top  right button to reserve enough Time Units for a Snap
Shot.
 
-  click on the bottom left button to reserve enough Time Units for an Aimed
Shot.

-  click on the bottom right button to reserve enough Time Units for an Auto
Shot.

3.2.3.15 Rank

This is an icon representing the currently selected soldier's rank.

XCom soldiers may have the following ranks: 

Rookie       Captain

Squaddie     Colonel

Sergeant     Commander

As  the  soldier's  rank  improves so too does the skill with which they can
fight.

3.2.3.16 Soldier Data
 
The  name  of the selected soldier is shown at the top of this section, with
statistics and information regarding the soldier shown underneath.

These statistics are displayed as both figures and bar charts and are colour
coded as follows:
 
Green    -  Time Units .
Orange   -  Energy .
Red      -  Health 
Purple   -  Morale 

Click on the Soldier Data box to view the Soldier Data screen.

This displays the soldier's name at the top of the screen with the following
information:-
 
Time Units - the soldier's remaining Time Units.  Time Units are required to
carry out everything from walking to firing weapons.

Energy  - the soldier's remaining energy.  This will decrease as the soldier
carries out energy consuming actions such as Walking through thick grass.

Health  -  the  soldier's current health.  This will decrease as the soldier
takes hits from enemy weapons.

Reactions  -  the  soldier's reactions.  This will allow the soldier to take
snap shots during the aliens turn.

Firing  Accuracy  -  the  soldier's  accuracy  at firing weapons.  This will
increase as the soldier becomes more experienced.

Throwing  Accuracy  - the soldier's accuracy at throwing objects.  This will
increase as the soldier- becomes more experienced.
 
Morale  -  the  soldier's  morale.  A soldier will lose morale if the battle
starts to swing in the alien's favour.  If the morale falls below 5O%, there
is a chance that the soldier could panic.
 
Bravery  -  the soldier's bravery.  This determines the likelihood of morale
decreasing.
 
Armour  Status - the soldier's armour status.  This will rise as the soldier
is equipped with armour manufactured by your engineers.
 
Psionic  Strength/Skill  -  the psionic strength/skill which the soldier may
call upon.

Click on the Right Mouse Button to return to the Battlescape screen.

3.2.4  PROMOTIONS

At  the end of every mission, subject to their mission performance, soldiers
will be promoted.

The rank to which the soldier is promoted is dependent on the following:-

Rookie - each new recruit begins at this level.

Squaddie - in order to be promoted to a Squaddie a Rookie must have had some
combat experience (cowering in the back of a Skranger doesn't count!).

Sergeant  -  there  is one sergeant per 5 soldiers.  If a position is vacant
the best available Squaddie is promoted.

Captain - there is one Captain per 11 soldiers.  If a position is vacant the
best available Sergeant is promoted.

Colonel - there is one Colonel per 23 soldiers.  If a position is vacant the
best available Captain is promoted.

Commander  -  this  is the supreme leader of Xcom forces - there is only one
Commander.    If  there  are at least 30 soldiers the best available Colonel
will be promoted.

It  does  not  automatically  follow that the higher the rank the better the
soldier, although this will tend to be the case.

3.2.4.1 The Effect of Rank

When  officers  accompany a mission then the morale of all the soldiers will
be  boosted and they will be less susceptible to panic.  The higher the rank
of the officer, the better the effect on the soldier's morale.

Note:  if  an officer is killed during a mission it will have a worse effect
on morale than if a rookie had been killed.

3.2.4.2 Mission Experience

When  soldiers return from a mission then their abilities may be increased. 
For a skill to benefit from experience it must be used during combat as much
as  possible.    For  example,  if  a  soldier  uses a rifle many times then
accuracy  is  likely  to improve.  Reactions, accuracy, Time Units, throwing
accuracy,  psionic  skill, health, strength, fitness and bravery all benefit
from mission experience.

3.2.4.3 Morale 

At  the  start  of  each mission each soldier's morale starts at 100%.  This
will  decrease if a soldier is wounded or if fellow soldiers are killed.  It
will  recover if a soldier successfully kills aliens.  The decline in morale
is  reduced by a soldier's Bravery rating - the more brave a soldier is, the
less likely they are to panic. 

3.2.4.4 Panic

When  morale falls the likelihood of panic increases.  When a soldier panics
one of three things can happen:-

A.    The  soldier  freezes,  and can do nothing for the current turn.  (ie.
he/she will have no Time Units)

B.    The soldier drops his/her weapon and runs away, searching for a hiding
place.

C.    The soldier goes berserk and starts firing at random.
 
Panic can also be caused by an alien psionic attack.
 
3.2.5  WOUNDING.

A  soldier's health is a general indication of well being, but a soldier can
also receive wounds.  These afflict a certain part of the body as follows:

Head, Left/Right Arm - each wound reduces the soldier's weapon accuracy.

Torso - each wound reduces the soldier's rate of Energy recovery.

Left/Right Leg - each wound reduces the soldier's available Time Units.
 
The  soldier  data  screen  displays  any wounds.  Each wound also reduces a
soldier's Health by one point per turn, so that it is possible for a soldier
to  die  from  a hit received much earlier in the mission.  The Medi kit can
heal wounds.

3.2.5.1 Stunning

Soldiers  or  aliens  can be stunned if hit by a stun weapon or if suffering
from smoke inhalation.

You  can  monitor the effect of smoke on your soldiers by checking the white
bar  on  the soldier's health bar.  If this advances as far as the soldier's
health level the soldier will collapse and may recover a few turns later.

Aliens can also be stunned and carried back to your craft.  However, if they
wake up they will jump out of the soldier's arms and run away!

3.2.6  OPPORTUNITY FIRE 

If  you end your turn leaving your soldiers with enough Time Units to fire a
shot,  your  soldiers  will automatically fire during the aliens turn at any
alien who strays into their line of sight This is called opportunity fire.

Your  soidiers  might  even  be able to take a shot before the aliens if the
soldier's Reactions and Time Units are high enough.
 
There  may  be  several  exchanges  of  fire  in   each   Opportunity   Fire
confrontation.
 
Note:  Opportunity  fire  is  crucial to mission success.  Remember to leave
your  soldiers  with enough Time Units at the end of their turn to carry out
opportunity fire - use the Reserve Time Units buttons to do this.

3.2.7 OBJECTIVE 

The  mission  will  be successful when all aliens have either been killed or
stunned.    The UFOs remains, alien artefacts and alien corpses will then be
recovered automatically.

To  abort the mission before the objectives have been achieved, click on the
button in the Control Bar. 

Note: any soldiers not on the transport at this stage will be left behind.

3.3 THE DEBRIEFING SCREEN

The  Debriefing  Screen is displayed at the end of the Ground Assault giving
you a breakdown of your mission performance.
 
The first line of this display tells you whether the mission objectives were
achieved.

Below  this  is the mission performance list, showing a breakdown of all the
Items  recovered,  the  Quantity  of each and the Score for retrieving them.
The last line of the mission performance list shows the total mission score.

At  the  bottom  of  the screen is the overall mission Rating.  Poor mission
performance may affect XCom funding.

Click  on  the  OK  button in the bottom left of the screen to return to the
Geoscape screen.

4. BASES
--------

Click on the Bases button in the Geoscape screen to access the Bases screen;
a  display  of  the  varions  XCom  installations  in  operation  or   under
construction.

XCom  bases are underground facilities, hidden from alien detection systems.
Craft  operate from concealed hangers and the only access to the base is via
the access lift(s).  XCom bases carry out several different functions:

- Detection of UFOs.

- Operation of XCom fighter and transport craft.

- Research into alien technology and life forms.

- Manufacture of vehicles, equipment and weapons for XCom use.

The  Bases  screen consists of two main parts: the Base Display and the Menu
Optious.

4.1 THE BASE DISPLAY

The  Base Display allows you to see, at a glance, the size of your bases and
their facilities.

XCom  may  have up to eight bases worldwide, these are represented above the
Menu  Options as a row of eight icons.   Each of these icons contain a small
map  of  the  facilities  which  make  up the base.  Green squares represent
existing  facilities,  red  squares represent facilities under construction.
Click on any of these icons to select a different base.

The  name  of  the  selected base is displayed in the top right of the bases
screen.    Below  this is the geographical area in which the base is located
followed by the total Funds available to XCom.

The  left two thirds of the Bases Screen shows a top down view of the base. 
Move  the  Mouse pointer over a base facility to display its name in the top
left of the screen.

4.2 THE MENU OPTIONS

The  Menu  Options  allow  you  to  see  in detail how each of your bases is
currently  functioning.    You  will use the Menu Options to carry out tasks
such as building facilities, aiming individual craft and organising research
and manufacture work.

Note:  At  times during the game, lists of information may extend beyond the
screen.    If  this happens, an arrow will appear in the bottom right of the
screen.   Similarly, if the list extends off the top of the screen, an arrow
will  appear  in the top right.  Click on these arrows to scroll the list up
or down.

4.2.1 BUILD NEW BASE

Click on this option to establish a new XCom base.

You  will  be taken to the Geoscape and the message Select Site For New Base
will  appear  at  the  top  of  the  screen - click on any part of the world
(except  the sea) to position the base.  You may cancel the order to build a
new base by clicking on the Cancel button.  Use the Geoscape controls if you
want  to  rotate the display of the Earth (see the section of this manual on
The Geoscape Screen for full details of the Geoscape controls)

When  you  have  selected  the location for your base, a message window will
appear  informing  you  of  the cost to establish a base in this part of the
world.    Click on OK to accept this location or click on Cancel to select a
different location.

Note:  As  you play the game, you will find that some areas of the world are
better than others for XCom base sites.  North America is a good area for an
XCom base because it is both large and wealthy.

When  you  have  decided on your new Base's location you will be prompted to
give  it  a  name - type in your bases name using the Keyboard and press the
Return Key.

You  will  now  be  taken  back  to  the Bases screen and prompted to Select
Position  For  Access  Lift.    This  will  position  the main access to the
facility  from  the surface.  It is better to position this fairly centrally
so that new facilities may be built around it.

You  have  now  established  a new XCom base.  Click on the Build Facilities
Menu Option to put some facilities into the base.

4.2.2 BASE INFORMATION

Click on this option to display a breakdown of base-related information.

The  Personnel  Available/ Personnel Total data shows how your personnel are
being  utilised.    It  is  broken  down into the three groups of personnel:
