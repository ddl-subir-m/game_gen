Hello, welcome to my OutRun FAQ. Well the reason I made this faq was because
there weren't any faqs made for this game and thought it would be nice to have
one up for people to get info from. Basically the other reason being is that
I loved the Sega Master System and it's unique collection of games :). I hope
this faq will be helpful to you because I'll be putting in as much info for
this game as possible, enjoy!

Btw, you'll notice the similarities between this FAQ and my Hang-On FAQ. Since
the two have very similar gameplay features (aside from a couple of
differences), the way this faq will be written will almost look exactly like
the Hang-On faq.

III. Gameplay
===============================================================================

-----------------
-Music Selection-
-----------------

After you get pass the title screen, the first thing you'll see is the music
selection screen. You get to select from 3 different music themes: Passing
Breeze (74.6), Magical Sound Shower (69.2) and Splash Wave (80.3). To select
Magical Sound Shower hold left on the d pad and to pick Splash Wave hold right
on the d pad. The game will only stick to this screen for a couple of seconds
so if you didn't pick anything yet then the game will pick what's currently
selected.

--------------------
-In Game Indicators-
--------------------

During the race you'll see the following 
indicators at the top of the screen:
---------------------------------
 SCORE     TIME  L  SPEED 000km/h
00000000    80   H   ||||||||
---------------------------------

-Score
This will show the current score you have, every second you are driving the
score will go up rapidly. There are other ways to get points but I'll explain
those parts later in this section of the faq.

-Time Limit
This indicator will show the current time you have left. At the beginning of
race you'll get 80 seconds, when you get to the second stage you'll receive
65 seconds, everything after that will differ. Whenever you cross a checkpoint,
the time you have remaining from the last stage will be added to your received
time, the remaining time when you reach the goal will be added to your score.
When time runs out before reaching a checkpoint or a goal, the game will end
and you'll be sent to either the name entry screen or title screen.

-Gears
You have two gears to shift through, L (low) and H (high), the gear you're
currently on will be highlighted in red. When you start the race or recover
from a crash, it'll always be set to the L gear.

-Speed
This shows how fast you are currently going in kilometers, the highest it can
go up is 298km/h.

-Tachometer
This also shows how fast you're currently going and appears below the SPEED
indicator. A row of blocks will appear from left to right and will rise or fall
depending on how fast or slow you're going. The higher the meter rises the
color of it will change, ten white blocks will be at the beginning, 4 yellow
blocks are in the middle and 1 red block will be at the end. There are actually
5 red blocks, but you only see them when you start up your car at the beginning
of the race, recovering from a crash or when dropping from the H gear to the L
gear.

----------
-Vehicles-
----------

The car you drive is a red car with an open top and sitting in the passenger
seat is a "woman". The car's name is never mentioned anywhere in the manual or
game but you can tell that it is modeled after the Ferrari Testarossa. There
are other cars you'll encounter during the race that will appear on screen,
they aren't really your opponents but they will get in your way. If you bump
into them, you'll either get pushed over a little bit or spin out of control
depending at how fast you were going, you'll also lose some speed of course.
Whenever you pass a car you'll receive 20,000 points.

-------------------
-Road Side Objects-
-------------------

-Starting Line
You'll see this at the beginning of the game, at the upper left part will be
three lights, two reds and one green. When the green light flashes the guy
will put down the checkered flag and the race will start.

-Arrow Signs
This will pop up when a turn is about to come up, they won't appear for every
turn though.

-Fork Road Sign
You'll see this green fork road sign right before the end of every stage,
they'll warn you that a fork in the road is coming up.

-Checkpoint
These giant signs with the words "CHECK" will appear at the end/beginning of
every stage, you'll recive more time when you pass through them.

-Finish Lines/Goals
You'll come across these if you're able to successfully get across 5 stages.
There are a total of 5 goals (a,b,c,d and e), each having a different outcome.
1 million points and your left over time will be added to your score when you
reach a goal.

-Other road side objects
These will range from a variety of things depending on what stage you are on.
From palm trees, road signs, houses, rocks etc., if you come into contact with
any of these, along with the the objects mentioned above (except Starting Line
and Goals), you will crash or spin out of control depending on how fast you
were going.

--------
-Stages-
--------

There is a total of 15 stages in the game, 5 of which you'll be able to go
through each time. Right at the end of each stage will be a split in the road
giving you the choice of picking between 2 stages. You'll only get a couple of
seconds to choose, so whichever side of the split you are on is the stage
you'll be going to. Below is the course map (which you see at the end of every
race) and the names of the stages in each location, I've decided to make it
vertical here because that's how you'll be looking at it in the game:
---------------------------------- 
  A      B      C       D      E
  |      |      |       |      |
  |      |      |       |      |
  11-----12-----13-----14-----15
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      |
     7------8------9------10
         |      |      |
         |      |      |
         4------5------6
             |      |
             |      |
             2------3
                |
                |
                1
----------------------------------

IV. Racing Tips
===============================================================================

-When you are waiting at the Starting Line, hold onto the accelerator button
instead of waiting to do it until the race starts.

-Make sure you're on the right gear and don't forget to switch to the H gear,
there are times you'll just forget because you are just caught up with what's
going on at the moment.

-If you're not sure which way the road is going to turn, it helps to stay in
the middle of the road. That way you have a better chance of not crashing if
you're on the wrong side when it happens.

-When you're sliding off the road when turning, let go of the accelerator
button. Depending on how close you are at the edge, if the skidding sound
stops, hold the accelerator button again and let go if you hear the skidding
noise again and repeat this over and over until the turn ends. If letting go of
the accelerator button doesn't help then hit the brake button, but don't hold
onto it too long or you'll come to a complete stop.

-When you are braking, don't forget to switch gears if the speed drops too much
or too high. If you don't then regaining speed will take much longer.

-During certain parts of a stage you'll encounter hills that will obscure the
road ahead. When this happens you'll usually bump into other cars or see turns
at the last second. Try to stay in the middle of the road and keep in mind
that other cars always stay on one lane. So when you see a car coming before
the hill appears move into another lane to avoid it.

-Whenever you pick a side at the fork in the road, get ready to turn in the
opposite direction to what you just turned. For example: if you pick the left
side of the split the next turn will be a right.

-When recovering from a crash and you see the tachometer go all the way up to
the red bars and you're still not moving, don't worry about it, just keep
holding onto the accelerator button and you'll move eventually.

-When changing from L gear to H gear, you should change around 170-175km/h.

V. Endings

-Goal A:
The car stops in front of the finish line where a crowd is waiting. A group of
people surround the driver and continually throws him into the air while the

poses, the men that were throwing the driver stops and stares at the woman and
the driver falls to the ground.

-Goal B:
The car stops in front of the finish line where a crowd is waiting. The car

-Goal C:
The car stops in front of the finish line where three camels are standing. The

and gives the trophy to the woman instead. The mans looks down and starts
playing with his fingers.

-Goal E:
The car stops in front of the finish line where a crowd is waiting. The driver
and woman get out of the car and the woman walks to the side of the car. The
