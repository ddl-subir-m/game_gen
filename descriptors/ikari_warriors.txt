 I.  INTRODUCTION
=============================================================================
What is Ikari Warriors?  It was originally an arcade game by SNK that 
featured two joysticks per player.  One was used for movement while the other 
was used to aim.  This allowed a precision like no other game had before.  
Not too many games used this two joystick model.  The most notable would 
probably be Smash T.V.  The game was one of military survival.  You took 
control of one of two soldiers, Paul and Vince, and guided them through enemy 
territory.  All you had with you were your grenades, your machine guns, and 
your wits.  It will be easier to follow the plot if you think of this game as 
a Rambo clone of sorts.

Ikari Warriors was ported to many home systems, one of them being the 
Nintendo Entertainment System.  That is where this guide comes in.  There 
were three Ikari Warriors games produced and this guide covers the first 
game.  This FAQ/Walkthrough is intended for use with the NES version only.  
If you are playing any other version, then this guide will most likely not be 
of much use.  Ikari Warriors for the NES can be frustrating to play so 
hopefully this guide will help people finish the game.  You can even finish 
the game without dying if you follow this guide.

     Initial release


=============================================================================
 III.  STORY
=============================================================================
(from back of game box)
You and a friend are warriors with secret orders to invade an enemy nation.  
Working together as a team, you must fight for survival against a relentless 
onslaught of enemies!


(my version)
Paul and Vince, the Ikari Warriors have crash landed into enemy territory.  
Armed with only their guns and grenades, they must fight their way into the 
heart of the enemy's base and destroy it.

 IV.  CONTROLS
=============================================================================
Basic controls
==============
Up      :  move player up
Down    :  move player down
Left    :  move player left
Right   :  move player right
B       :  shoot
A       :  throw grenades, enter a tank or chopper
Select  :  select two player game
Start   :  start game, pause/resume game
A+B     :  exit a tank or chopper


Other controls
==============
Aiming in the tank
------------------
To change the direction of your aim while inside a tank, just hold down the A 
button and use the D-pad to change your aim in 8 different directions.

Aiming in the chopper
---------------------
Aiming is by pressing in the direction that you want to fire in with the D-
pad and pressing B button to fire guns and A button to fire 
grenades/missiles.  Unfortunately, aiming and moving the chopper both require 
the D-pad so you may want to just tap the direction instead of holding it 
down to limit any unnecessary movement.


=============================================================================
 V.  GAMEPLAY
=============================================================================
Objective
---------
Your goal is to run through each area until you reach the end.  Then repeat 
the process again until you have completed all 4 areas.  You do not have to 
kill enemies along the way although survival without doing so is highly 
unlikely.

Player status
-------------
Information about your status is shown in the top left corner for the first 
player and the top right corner for the second player.  Your current score is 
listed first.  Below that are two numbers.  The top number is the amount of 
grenades that you have left.  The bottom number is the amount of bullets you 
have left.

Lives
-----
You start out with 3 lives.  You can earn an additional life at 50,000 points 
and another one at 100,000 points.  You will get an extra life every 100,000 
points afterwards.  You'll hear a tone when you get the extra life.

Scoring
-------
There are many ways to get points in the game.  Here are the different point 
values awarded for different actions.  Enemies are killed while objects are 
destroyed.

*Soldier                         100 points
Chopper                          600 points
Destroying a wall/gate/door     1000 points
Getting powerup                  200 points
Gold box                        1000 points
Gold clock                      2000 points
Gold watch                      5000 points
Grenade soldier                  200 points
Little Athena              1500-5000 points
Macho man                       1000 points
Moving cannon                    400 points
Oil drum soldier                1000 points
Scorpion/killer bee              200 points
Super tank                      1000 points
Tank                             800 points
Task force soldier              1000 points

Clearing an area will give you 10,000 x # where # is the number of the 
current area (i.e. area 2 gives you 20,000, area 3 30,000 and so on.  If you 
continue playing after area 4, then finishing area 1 the second time around 
will get you 50,000 points.  This cumulative effect will continue for every 
level afterwards that you complete.

*"Soldier" includes red soldiers, armored soldiers, green soldiers, etc.


=============================================================================
 VI.  ITEMS/POWERUPS
=============================================================================
Weapon Powerups
===============
These items will enhance your gun and grenades.  They are found by killing 
red soldiers.

B (bomb)
Your grenades will cause a larger explosion area.  Tank shots will similarly 
be upgraded to cause a larger explosion.

F (fire)
Your shots will now be colored red.  They will not be stopped if they hit a 
target.  They will travel over walls and other obstacles.  They can even 
destroy stone faces and bunkers.  Tank bullets will be upgraded to missiles 
which can travel over walls.

L (long range)
Your shots will go farther.

S (speed)
It won't make you move faster but it will make your shots move faster.


Green Soldier Item
==================
This item is found exclusively by killing the rare green soldiers.

K (kill)
All enemies currently on the screen will die.  This will not work on any 
enemies underwater at the moment you get the K.


Supply Powerups
===============
These items will replenish your bullet, grenade, and fuel (for tank & 
chopper) supply.  They are dropped by gun turrets, bunkers, blockades, enemy 
tanks, and fortress gates.

Bullets (gun icon)
Give you the max (99) bullets.

Fuel (gas canister)
Adds more fuel to your supply.

Grenades (grenade icon)
Adds 50 grenades to your supply.


Secret items
============
The following items are all hidden and must be uncovered by shooting at the 
correct spot.  Using any other attack other than bullets will not reveal the 
item even if you are at the correct spot.  Tank shots will also work.  These 
items only add points to your score.

Gold Bars
Adds 5,000 points to your score

Gold Box
Adds 1,000 points to your score

Gold Clock
Adds 2,000 points to your score

Little Athena (girl)
Adds 1,500, 2,500, or 5,000 points to your score


Secret powerups
===============
The following powerups are all hidden and must be uncovered by shooting at 
the correct spot.  Using any other attack other than bullets will not reveal 
the powerup even if you are at the correct spot.  Tank shots will also work.

Gold Heart
The ultimate powerup.  It gives you the B, F, L, and S powerups.  You also 
get the hidden powerups like SS, knife, and heart.  Your ammo will also be 
fully replenished.

H (super fuel)
Refills both grenades and bullets to max values (99).  You will get 200 
seconds of fuel for the tanks.

Heart (retain items)
You will not lose the powerups that you have if you die.  This only applies 
to the first death after you get this item.  If you die a second time 
afterwards, then you will lose all of your powerups.  Getting multiple hearts 
will not cause a cumulative effect (i.e. you will still lose your items after 
more than one death even if you get more than one heart).  You will lose your 
items if you lose your last life and then resume play via the continue code.

Knife
You can kill enemies by touching them.  Will also allow you to touch 
otherwise deadly objects like blockades.  The explosions from their 
destruction can still kill you though.  Special enemies like the macho men 
will no longer kill you by contact but you will not kill them either.  Lasers 
will not kill you either.

SS (super speed)
You move faster.

Triple Shot (3 dots)
Lets you fire three shots out in three directions at once.  All other 
powerups to your gun (F, L, S) will be cancelled out.


Vehicles
========
You can acquire two vehicles to use against the enemy.  They both operate on 
fuel and will self destruct when the fuel supply runs out.  Tanks can be 
found lying around and by destroying other enemy tanks.  Choppers can only be 
found lying around.

Chopper
Bullet proof and flies over enemies.  It can fire shots in three directions 
or shoot tank shots (missiles).  It is vulnerable to everything except 
bullets, normal soldiers, and other choppers.  Things like land mines, self 
destruct soldiers, and explosions will destroy the chopper even though you 
would think that you would be able to fly over them.  The chopper will self 
destruct if it runs out of fuel.

Tank
Bullet proof and can run over enemies.  Shots are based on your grenade 
total.  It is vulnerable to everything except for bullets (both regular and F 
bullets).  The tank will self destruct if it runs out of fuel.


=============================================================================
 VII.  ENEMIES
=============================================================================
All enemies listed have been assigned unofficial names by me.  These names 
will be used throughout this FAQ to refer to each individual enemy.

Blue Soldiers
=============
There are a lot of different blue soldiers so here are the different kinds 
you can encounter.

Coward Soldiers
These guys run at you and then run away when you get too close.  They do not 
fire any shots.

FL Soldiers
These guys are powered up with fire bullets that travel long distances.

Flame Thrower Soldiers
These guys sit and fire flames out at you.  They will become grenade soldiers 
if you walk past them.

Fortress Soldiers
These guys stand still and wait to toss B-grenades at you if you get too 
close.  Primarily positioned in fortress areas, these guys can also be found 
outside of fortresses.

Grenade Soldiers
These guys will walk around after you and toss grenades at you.

Homing Missile Soldiers
These guys fire missiles that come after you.  They will become grenade 
soldiers if you walk past them.

Kamikaze Soldiers

will follow you in the water even.  They will kill themselves and you by 
touching you.  They can dive underwater too.

Missile Soldiers
These guys are armed with missile launchers and fire them at you if you get 
near.  They will become grenade soldiers if you walk past them.

Regular Soldiers
These guys run around randomly firing.

Self Destruct Soldiers
These guys look like regular soldiers but will self destruct if you get too 
close.  They tend to walk diagonally towards you and pause in their walk.  
They can dive underwater too.

These guys have shields to protect against bullets.  They move around like 
the macho men and also take two grenades to kill.



Enemy Vehicles/Hazards/Structures
=================================
Arrow Cannons
Camouflaged to match the jungle terrain, this weapon fires arrows out.

Blockades
Small obstacle marked with a small skull and crossbones.  Rigged to explode 
on contact.

Brown Tanks
A slow moving tank that fires either regular shots or missiles.

Bunkers
Marked with a skull and crossbones, this stone building will fire shots out 
in three directions.

Choppers
A green chopper that fires three shots in a spread.

Fortress Gates
Giant doors that block progress through a fort.  Lined with explosives that 
explode on contact.

Green Tanks
A faster version of the brown tank.

Homing Sensors
A small detector that blinks will appear if you get within range.  Shortly 
afterwards, a missile will be fired at the spot that is blinking.  The 
missile will only fire if the detector is on screen for a few seconds.  A 
missile that has been fired cannot be stopped.  The time before a missile 
comes out varies between sensors.

Land Mines
Small gray boxes marked with "X"'s that explode on contact.  Mines can also 
be found in the water.  They will move towards the player while in water.

Missiles
If you take too long to move the screen forward, missiles will be fired at 
you.  This is useful to get out of places that you get stuck in like walls or 
other obstacles.

Moving Cannons
Small cannon that moves along ceiling or floor tracks.

Skull Doors
Giant doors marked with a skull and crossbones that block progress through a 
fortress.  Some doors are fake and will not open even after you destroy them.

Super Tanks
The most powerful tank of them all.  These will fire larger shots which 
explode with B-grenade power.  They also take twice the damage to destroy as 
opposed to regular tanks.

Yellow Tanks
Can move or be stationary.  Moving ones are identical to brown tanks.  
Stationary ones fire missiles.

 VIII.  WALKTHROUGH
=============================================================================
How to use this walkthrough
===========================
This walkthrough will guide you through the entire game from start to finish.  
I will be using strategies according to how I play the game.  This does not 
mean that I always take the best path possible although I try to.  The 
walkthrough is divided into the four main areas.  Each area is further 
subdivided into its different gates.  You'll know that you are at a gate 
because the music changes.

I assume that the reader already is familiar with the controls of the game 
(see section "Controls") so I will not spend time explaining the controls.  I 
also strongly advise that the reader be familiar with the enemies in the game 
(see section "Enemies").  There is no official name for the enemies but I 
refer to the different types constantly and it will be necessary to know my 
naming convention in order to follow the strategy correctly.

While dying is almost inevitable, it is possible albeit very difficult, to 
finish the game without dying at all.  The strategies that I use don't depend 
on having a powered up character although having one will make surviving and 
hence winning a whole lot easier.  The walkthrough is intended to be used for 
one player games but it can be adapted for use with two players too.  Just 
follow the same strategy but make minor changes here and there like sharing a 
vehicle (see "Secrets" section below on how to share a vehicle).  The second 
player should make it easier since there is another person killing soldiers.  
This walkthrough is intended to be read from start to finish so I can't 
guarantee that all the strategies will work if you don't follow it from start 
to finish.  Use as little/much as you need.

Forward movement
----------------
Since the game encourages you to always be moving the screen forward, I 
expect the user to also do be moving at a reasonable rate.  Reasonable in 
this case means that you do not wait for the missiles to be fired although 
there are some cases where this cannot be avoided.

Hidden Items
------------
There are many hidden items in the game and I will try my best to find them 
all.  It is to be expected that I may have missed some hidden items so do not 
be worried if you unexpectedly find a hidden item that is not covered in the 
walkthrough.

Notation/Terminology
--------------------
Since the entire game is played with you moving north, I won't say to move 
north or move up all the time.  I may say to "move forward" which should be 
interpreted as moving north.

When I refer state to move to the left, right, and center, I am talking about 
moving east or west.  Movement going north and south will only scroll the 
screen forward.

Destroying enemy tanks will sometimes yield tanks that you can enter.  These 
tank appearances are random.  I assume that the reader knows to enter them 
when they appear and only if necessary (i.e. don't enter a tank if you 
already have one).


                       ##############################
                       ##          Area 1          ##
                       ##############################

Start
=====
Your plane has just crashed.  Ok, it's time for Paul and Vince, our Ikari 
Warriors, to fight their way through enemy territory.  Start your mission 
with your guns blazing if you want.

Just head up.  You don't have to shoot enemies yet because they don't shoot 
and will run away after getting too close to you.  These are known as coward 
soldiers.  You'll soon come to an enemy gun turret towards the left side.  It 
will be firing a stream of three bullets.  You should be able to see a safe 
spot to stand in between the middle and right shots that it fires.  Stand 
there and toss a grenade to destroy the turret.  Watch out for enemy soldiers 
now because the regular soldiers will shoot at you.  Shoot them if they get 
too close for comfort.  The turret drops grenades.  Pick it up and continue 
forward.  Start shooting enemies that you encounter.  While only one or two 
will fire at you, it is best that you get accustomed to shooting enemies 
quickly and efficiently now.  They may not all be firing for the time being, 
but they will be soon enough so it's important to get as much practice as you 
can.  Try to be able to fire in three directions quickly just like the gun 
turret did.  Mastering this tactic will keep you alive longer.

Keep going up and you'll soon see two tanks.  Enter one of them (press the A 
button when you are on top of the tank).  Tanks need fuel to run so that is 
shown by the gas tank icon below the grenades.  The number is how many 
seconds you have before the tank runs out of gas.  In Ikari Warriors, running 
out of fuel will cause tanks to self destruct.  Therefore, you will need to 
grab fuel canisters along the way to keep yourself from running out of gas.  
Tanks are bullet-proof and can run over soldiers.  However, they are 
vulnerable to everything else ranging from grenades, mines, missiles, and 
flames to arrows and explosions.

Now that you are in a tank, you can destroy the other one for points if you 
wish (or to keep the second player from getting a tank).  I'll assume that 
you are in a tank for the next few areas.  While it isn't necessary for you 
to be in one, you will tend to live longer and get farther than you would 
without one.  Now move up and you'll see a red soldier.  These guys will drop 
powerup items if you kill them directly.  This can be done either by firing 
at, grenading, or running them over.  They will not drop anything if they die 
from a secondary attack such as the explosion from a destroyed gun turret.  
The red soldiers will run away if they get too close to you.  Fire at them 
before this happens.  They will always run north.  This can be used to your 
advantage by positioning yourself above them and then turning around and 
firing as they run at you.  This is more of a show-off move rather than being 
particularly useful.

Kill the red soldier before he runs away.  He will drop an F.  Get it to 
upgrade your shots so that they now go over walls and other obstacles.  They 
won't stop after hitting a target.  They can even destroy gun turrets and 
bunkers.  Your tank shells will also be upgraded to missiles.  Move to the 
right side now.  Head up.  You'll soon see another red soldier.  He also 
drops an F.  Move up and you'll see a bunker.  Destroy it with grenades or 
tank shells.  It will leave fuel behind.  Be careful not to run your tank 
into the explosion.  Get the fuel.  Right after the fuel will be a green 
soldier.  He will appear and run away quickly so shoot him when he appears.  
He'll drop a K behind.  Grab it to kill everyone on the screen which should 
be a total of four soldiers.  This takes out the two flame thrower soldiers 
on the left side.  Now head up and you'll see a blue soldier run down at you.  
Kill him quickly because he is a grenade soldier.  Move towards him if you 
are in a tank to avoid the grenades.  Move up and you'll face two red 
soldiers.  They drop an S and an L respectively.  S will increase your 
shots' speed while L makes your shots long range.

Now head up the middle and fire while doing so.  You'll face a few grenade 
soldiers.  You'll come to a stone face.  It will fire arrows out if you get 
too close.  Never stand directly in front of it or the center arrow that it 
fires will hit you.  Stand to one side of its mouth.  Then move close enough 
that it starts firing arrows.  The arrows will miss.  Now destroy the face by 
firing from the tank or by tossing a grenade.  Right past the face will be a 
tank that you can use.  Be careful when approaching this tank because there 
are two land mines placed in front of it.  They are designed to kill you and 
to destroy the tank with their explosions.  Walk around the mines and enter 
the tank.  Head up and you'll face a brown tank.  It will move left and right 
while firing shots at you.  You should have the advantage since you picked up 
the long range powerup.  Fire from the tank or toss a grenade to destroy it.  
Get the fuel that it drops.  Head up again and you'll run into a bunker.  
Destroy it and get the fuel it leaves behind.

Continue forward to run into a red soldier.  He drops an L.  Now there should 
be a red soldier approaching you from the right.  Move up enough until he is 
directly to your right side.  Now turn your aim to the right (hold A button 
and press the D-pad in different directions) and wait for him to come to you.  
Fire when he gets close enough.  He'll drop an S.  Readjust your aim north 
and continue forward.  You'll see a bridge with two stationary shooters on 
it.  A red soldier appears from the north.  He drops an F behind.  Now don't 
bother adjusting your aim.  Keep it aimed north and just run over the 
soldiers on the bridge.  Then head across the bridge to the north.  Keep 
going until you hit the water.  Now to the left will be a red soldier moving 
towards you.  Quickly turn your aim left and let the soldier approach.  Kill 
him when he gets out of the water and back on land.  He'll drop a B.  Grab 
it.  B-grenades are very powerful.  Now you have a fairly powerful character.  
Fire at the gun turret from afar to destroy it.  It leaves bullets behind.  
Now to the left of the gun turret is a flame thrower soldier.  Shoot him from 
a safe distance.  Don't pass him or he'll become a grenade soldier and chase 
after you.

Now head up across the suspension bridge.  Stay in the center of the bridge 
to avoid the land mines to the right side.  Keep firing away as you move.  
Your B-grenades and missiles will take out all comers.  You'll kill some red 
soldiers while doing this.  They'll drop an F and a B.  You'll then see a 
blockade at the end of the bridge.  Destroy it to find some bullets and 
grenades.  Head up and you'll face kamikaze soldiers.  Kill them as soon as 
possible because they will not run away if they get near.  Actually, they 
will pursue you until they ultimately kill both you and themselves by 
touching you.  Some of them even fire shots as they chase you.  You'll fight 
a red soldier afterwards.  He drops an S.  Continue forward and you'll run 
into missile soldiers.  Take them out from a distance.

Then head forward and you'll see the first fortress gate.  There are two 
fortress soldiers on either side of the gate.  They are armed with B-grenades 
and will use them if you get too close.  Their attack range is just smaller 
than your grenade range so get close to them and grenade them.  Your powered 
up tank should have no problem taking them out.  Never attack the fortress 
soldiers diagonally unless you have no other choice because their diagonal 
attack range is greater than your diagonal grenade's range.  Take out the 
gate once the fortress soldiers are dead.  You can simply run through it with 
a tank.  Don't stop or you'll get caught in the explosion.  The safer and 
preferred method is to toss a grenade or fire from the tank.  The gate leaves 
bullets and grenades behind.  Head on up through gate 1.


Gate 1
======
Now above you is a bunker and a tank that you can enter.  Take out the bunker 
first.  It leaves fuel behind.  Then enter the tank even if you already have 
one because it will start off with a fresh tank of gas.  Head up and you'll 
see a green tank.  This tank is an upgraded version of the brown tank that 
you encountered earlier because it moves a lot faster.  It still fires the 
same shots but these shots can still kill you so quickly move backward once 
it appears.  You should be able to avoid getting hit.  Now get within grenade 
range and destroy the tank.  Then continue forward.  Watch out for a land 
mine near the water.  Now head up on the land until you see the next green 
tank.  It will be moving across a bridge.  Take it out fast.  Now you'll see 
two tanks on the left side that you can enter.  Don't get too anxious yet.  
Go across the bridge and you'll see a bunker.  Take the bunker out first 
before you enter the tanks.  It leaves fuel behind that is just perfect for 
the tanks.

There is a catch to the fuel though.  A homing sensor is placed near the 
location of the fuel.  The sensor will summon a homing missile very quickly 
so grab the fuel and then move backwards.  You will be able to avoid the 
missile's explosion.  Now get back to the right side by using the bridge.  
Head up and you'll encounter a brown tank.  Destroy it.  Head up a little 
more to fight another brown tank from the left side.  Get out of its range 
and destroy it from a safe distance.  What looks like a red soldier will 
appear as well.  This is actually fake red soldier.  He is fake because he 
leaves no item behind and dies like all the other soldiers (i.e. body flies 
away).  Continue forward and you'll see three real red soldiers.  They drop 
an S and two L's respectively.  The red soldiers are accompanied by grenade 
soldiers so take out the grenade soldiers first.  Letting the red soldiers 
escape is better than losing a tank simply because you didn't kill the 
grenade soldier first.  Head up and you face more grenade soldiers.  Take 
them out quickly.  Now stay in the center of the screen.  You should hear a 
"choop" sound as you head up.  Then a super tank appears.  This piece of 
heavy artillery will fire B-shells out.  It will take two regular 
grenades/tank shots or one B-grenade to defeat the super tank.  Stay out of 
its firing path and quickly destroy it.  You'll need to time your grenades 
throws here because the tank moves pretty fast.

Continue up and you'll see a fortress soldier to the left.  I recommend that 
you kill him because he'll be a nuisance later.  Now head up and you'll be at 
the foot of the second gate.  Deal with it like before by taking out the 
fortress soldiers first.  Then destroy the gate to get fuel.  Now above you 
are two soldiers, one on each side.  They are both self destruct soldiers so 
kill them fast or they will explode when they get near you.  This applies 
even if you are in a tank so just kill them.  I suggest killing the right 
side one first because he is closer than the left side one.  Now there is 
another gate to destroy.  Take it out the same way as usual by killing off 
the fortress guards first and the gate later.  You should be starting to get 
the hang of it now.  I shouldn't have to remind you that the fortress guards 
are armed with B-grenades but I'll do so anyway.  Get the fuel that the gate 
leaves behind.  Then go up through gate 2.


Gate 2
======
Head up and you'll see three rocks in a triangle formation.  Do not, I 
repeat, do not go to the left side of the center rock.  There is a homing 
sensor placed between the left and center rocks that will kill you if you 
charge in there.  Go either to the far left side or the right side instead.  
You'll now see a bunker.  Just destroy it while being careful to avoid 
activating the homing sensor.  The bunker leaves behind bullets and fuel.  
There is a homing sensor placed by the bullets and fuel so be extra careful 
as you grab it.  Stick to the right side and head up until you see a blockade 
by a bridge.  Don't blow it up yet.  Move up until you see a red soldier 
appear.  Now wait for him to walk past the blockade before shooting him.  If 
you had destroyed the blockade, the red soldier would have died via a 
secondary effect (the blockade's explosion) and would not have dropped 
anything.  The soldier leaves an F behind.  The blockade drops bullets.  
Continue forward again.  Watch out for the soldiers in the area as a few of 
them are kamikaze soldiers.  You should be able to tell them apart from the 
other blue soldiers by the way they walk.  Another red soldier will appear as 
you head forward.  Kill him for a B.

Now head across the bridge and destroy the bunker at the left side.  You'll 
get grenades and fuel.  There's a homing sensor planted under the fuel so 
don't stop moving after you pick it up.  There are a few kamikaze soldiers 
that will appear from the left side so take them out.  If you still have the 
tank, you have to get out now.  Do so only when you've taken out the enemies 
on the screen.  Then go to the center of the screen and try to stay to the 
right side.  Head up and you'll see two self destruct soldiers swimming 
diagonally to you from both sides.  You can only kill them if they surface 
for air so make your shots count.  Quickly take them both out with grenades 
and/or shots.  I personally kill the left soldier by shooting diagonally at 
him.  Then I quickly move to the right so that the right soldier is directly 
to my north and shoot him then.  If you fail to kill them before they get 
within self destruct range then you will die unless you have the super speed 
(SS) powerup.  Continue forward after you kill them.  Keep moving to avoid 
the land mines that are following you.  Now in the center is a stationary 
shooter.  Stand to the right side of his center line of fire and toss a 
grenade to kill him.  It may be difficult to do with the mine chasing you so 
first get past the mine before you try to get to the shooter's right side.

Now above you is a gray chopper.  Do NOT grenade it or you will destroy a 
valuable vehicle and the easiest way to beat the next part.  Approach it from 
the chopper's direct south.  There are two land mines placed around the 
chopper.  If the mines explode, then kiss that chopper goodbye.  You will 
avoid the mines if you approached from the direct south.  Don't forget to 
keep firing shots (but not grenades) to defend against oncoming enemy 
soldiers.  Enter the chopper (press the A button) after you get to it.  You 
have 28 seconds of fuel.  Now head forward and do not stop for anything and I 
mean ANYTHING!  Do not engage the enemy.  Do not blow up enemy choppers or 
you'll be destroyed in their explosion.  Do not touch land mines because they 
can still kill you even if you're in a chopper.  Do not destroy the bunkers 
because they don't provide fuel (the first one has bullets and grenades while 
the second one has nothing).  Just keep pressing UP to head forward and B to 
keep firing.  Don't press A or you might accidentally destroy an enemy 
chopper and get caught in the subsequent explosion.  You can safely touch 
enemy choppers so just fly through them.  You'll encounter 4 red soldiers as 
you fly up.  They drop two B's and two F's between them.  You will kill the 
first two as you fly up because they are in your flight path.  As you can 
see, you would have had to fight your way through hordes of stationary 
shooters if you didn't have the chopper.  If you don't have the chopper then 
slowly kill the stationary shooters one by one and move slowly.

Keep flying up and you'll then see a green soldier.  Do not kill him yet.  
Just keep flying up and you'll chase after him.  Try to fly northeast (press 
UP and RIGHT) until you are directly behind him.  You'll eventually see land.  
Kill the soldier the second you see land or you can wait until you see the 
first fortress wall but it's not necessary to wait that long.  Then fly up 
but don't get the K that the soldier dropped.  Head up and you'll see two 
stationary shooters.  Stop and get the K when you see them.  You will 
probably take out everyone.  If a kamikaze soldier avoided the K by staying 
underwater, then quickly touch him with the chopper or shoot him.  Then get 
out and away from the chopper before it self destructs.  Destroy the gate and 
you'll get bullets and grenades.  Then head through gate 3.


Gate 3
======
Head forward and you'll see a tank.  Two red soldiers attack you.  Don't use 
grenades or you'll destroy the tank.  Shoot the left one first.  Then run 
south.  The right soldier should get caught in the fortress wall.  Now shoot 
him if you have fire bullets.  Grenade him if and only if you have regular 
grenades.  B-grenades will destroy the tank.  Now get the F and B that the 
soldiers dropped.  Enter the tank quickly because two more red soldiers will 
attack you.  Kill them to get another F and another B.  Head up along the 
center of the screen and fire away as you move.  You'll destroy two brown 
tanks that appear near the center of the screen.  Now try not to lose the 
tank because you are armed with B-missiles which will make this next part 
very easy to pass.  Head up and you'll see another brown tank.  Destroy it 
from a distance.  The buildings on the left and right sides each have boarded 
up doorways.  You can destroy the doorways with tank shots or grenades.  This 
will get you points but is otherwise unnecessary.  Head up again and another 
brown tank engages you.  Destroy this one and continue moving.

You'll see two stationary shooters on both sides.  They can't do anything to 
you since you're inside a tank.  So ignore them and move up to fight another 
brown tank.  Destroy it.  Then turn your aim on the two stationary shooters 
and shoot them to not only kill them but also to destroy the boarded 
doorways.  Now move to the far right side and head up.  A brown tank will 
appear towards the right side.  You should be out of its firing path as long 
as you don't get too close to it.  Wait for an opening and fire when you see 
it.  Now move to the center but slightly to the right.  Head up and a brown 
tank comes down the center of the screen.  Back up and destroy it.  Then move 
up a little and another brown tank appears.  Take it out and get the fuel 
that it drops.  Now get in the center of the screen and fire away 
continuously as you move.  You'll eventually fight 3 brown tanks that appear 
in the center of the screen.  Firing away continuously will let you kill them 
all without getting shot at.  Now go left until you are next to the grass 
that is to the right of the left building's shadow.  If that sounds 
confusing, then just leave a space that is a little more than half the width 
of your tank between yourself and the left building's shadow.

Head up.  Fire away if you want but don't waste all of your ammo.  You'll 
soon see a green tank roll out at you.  Quickly take it down before it can 
fire a shot.  Don't get caught in the explosion though.  Do not move up 
anymore or you'll scroll the screen forward.  Go right and stand one tank 
width away from the right building.  Now you must have B-powered shots or 
this next trick won't work.  If you don't have B-grenades then just slowly 
move forward and take each tank out one by one.  Otherwise, head up and fire 
away with your tank.  Do not stop moving.  You'll destroy another green tank.  
Keep moving up and firing.  A second green tank appears.  However, it gets 
caught in the your shots' explosions is destroyed.  Keep moving and a third 
tank appears.  Now the second tank's explosion will catch this tank and 
destroy it in a chain reaction.  Continue moving up and a fourth tank 
appears.  It will get caught in the third tank's explosion and be destroyed 
as well.  Head up and you'll see four stone faces.  Destroy them all and get 
the fuel in the middle.

Stay to the left side of the screen and continue forward to find yourself in 
front of what I call "the gauntlet."  This next area has arrow cannons on one 
side and fortress guards all armed with B-grenades on the other.  As if that 
wasn't enough, homing sensors and land mines are scattered around in the area 
as well.  Start by going to the left side of the screen if you're not already 
there.  Then move forward until you pass the firing path of the arrow cannon 
to the right.  You will safely pass by before an arrow is even fired.  You'll 
also activate two homing sensors while doing so but ignore them and move up 
until you are out of the arrow cannon's firing path.  Stop moving up when you 
activate a homing sensor near the left arrow cannon.  Now move right until 
you are in the center of the screen.  The homing sensor to the left should 
have been deactivated.  Move a little more to the right if it is not.  Now 
the left arrow cannon is firing arrows by now.  Move up until you are as 
close to the arrow's firing path as possible.  Then wait for it to pass by 
and immediately move up when it does.  You should just barely pass by.  If 
you are still in a tank then just keep moving up.  As long as you stay in the 
center and keep moving up, you should be able to pass by the rest of the 
arrow cannons.  You'll activate homing sensors while doing so but ignore 
them.  This works for the most part but if you are worried or are not in a 
tank then you'll need to move up and pass each arrow cannon one at a time.  
You can also stand in the shadows to avoid the arrows but that requires you 
to kill the soldiers guarding the shadows.

You'll soon see two red soldiers appear to the right.  Do not chase after 
them.  Their purpose is to lure you into the fortress soldiers' B-grenades.  
They drop an S and L but it is not worth it.  Just keep moving up the center 
until you clear the range of the left fortress guard's attack range.  Then 
move to the left side until you are next to the far left wall.  Head up and 
you'll activate a homing sensor by a triangular wall to the north.  The 
missile comes out almost immediately after you activate the sensor so quickly 
move through the opening to the left and up past the wall.  You'll avoid the 
missile if you were close to the left side and reacted quickly.  Before you 
head up, you can go right and shoot the shadows by the far right wall to find 
a hidden knife.  You'll notice that there is a wide area of shadow under the 
wall running horizontally and a very narrow strip of shadow by the far right 
wall running vertically.  The knife is below the wider area of shadow.  Shoot 
that narrow strip to find it.  The knife will be most useful against kamikaze 
soldiers because it lets you kill enemies by touching them.  It is also one 
of the rare hidden items in this level.

Now head up and watch out for another homing missile by the wall.  You'll now 
see flame thrower soldiers above you and a tank to the right.  Kill the 
soldiers first.  You're probably at 50 fuel or less by now so I recommend 
switching to the new tank to get a full tank of gas.  Head up and a gun 
turret is in your way.  Destroy it to get bullets.  Then proceed up to a 
suspension bridge.  Keep firing away to kill all the troops that come.  
You'll also kill some red soldiers.  They leave two S's and two L's behind.  
At the end of the bridge is an enemy chopper.  Be careful not to get caught 
in its explosion as you destroy it.  Then head up and you'll face two super 
tanks.  Stay to the side of one of the tank's firing path.  This will keep 
both tanks firing directly south.  Now fire away if you're in a tank or use 
grenades if you're on foot.  Destroy one tank before working on the other.  
Head up once you've destroyed them both.

You'll see a fortress.  There are two fortress guards on the right side but 
only one on the left side.  Take out the left fortress guard out.  Then 
scroll the screen up until you see the gate.  Stay to the left side and 
slowly head up until you hit the north wall.  Then turn your aim northeast 
and fire at the gate when you get close enough.  Fuel is left behind.  Head 
through the gate.  You may activate a homing missile while doing so but only 
if you were far back from the gate.  This shouldn't happen but I'm warning 
you just in case.


Gate 4
======
Head up and ignore the soldiers since they don't shoot.  You'll see one 
soldier just standing in the center of the screen.  That is a fortress guard.  
He's armed with B-grenades and will use them if you get close enough.  Take 
him out carefully.  Then continue forward to find a bunker.  Destroy it.  
You'll get the usual bullets and grenades.  Then go up and there are two 
tanks for the taking.  Homing sensors are planted near each tank.  Do not get 
the tanks unless you don't have one.  If you already are in a tank, then just 
go the far left side around the rocks and skip them.  If you have to take a 
tank, then get the left one because a homing sensor activates if you take the 
right one.  Head up and you'll find a bunker and a missile soldier.  Destroy 
the bunker to get bullets and grenades.  The missile soldier will die from 
the bunker's explosion.  Now a red soldier appears.  Kill him for an F.  Head 
up and two soldiers appear on either side of the topmost rock.  These are 
both self destruct soldiers.  They can destroy tanks so kill them quickly.  I 
recommend retreating backwards and then moving left to kill the left soldier.  
Then turn your aim northeast to take out the right one.

Head up to the water's edge next.  A kamikaze soldier will appear.  Don't 
bother wasting ammo on him.  Just let him run into your tank and he'll kill 
himself.  This is a handy little trick that will save you from many a 
soldier.  Now get out of the tank and head up.  Do not scroll the tank off 
the bottom of the screen.  Another kamikaze soldier comes at you.  You 
probably already knew that since he was diving underwater.  Well just run 
back to your tank and get in.  Let the soldier walk right to his death.  Then 
get out and head up the middle.  Take out soldiers that get too close for 
comfort or are in your attack radius.  If you have B-grenades, then use them.  
You'll soon be attacked by a self destruct soldier from the northwest.  Turn 
your aim diagonally northwest and take him out.  Then head up again.  Two 
more self destruct soldiers will appear, this time from the right side.  
Adjust your aim and shoot and grenade them.  Then head up again and a 
kamikaze soldier attacks from the center.  Kill him and then continue 
forward.  You'll see two arrow cannons in front of a fortress.  Move near the 
first arrow cannon until it fires.  Then get your head close enough to the 
arrows' firing path and wait.  Let an arrow pass and then immediately run 
past the firing path.  You should make it without major problem.  Now grenade 
the gate to destroy it.  It leaves bullets and grenades behind.  Then move up 
and pass the other arrow cannon when you see the opportunity arise.


Gate 5
======
Head up slowly.  Keep moving slowly until you see a self destruct soldier 
appear.  Now run back and hide behind the left fortress wall.  The soldier 
will get stuck against the wall where you can safely grenade him.  Head up 
slowly until you see another self destruct soldier appear.  A fake red 
soldier will also appear.  Ignore the red soldier and run back behind the 
right fortress wall.  The self destruct soldier will also get caught against 
the wall.  Grenade him and then move up again.  A kamikaze soldier will 
appear.  Take him out quickly.  Then stay in the middle and head up to face 
one more self destruct soldier.  Quickly shoot or grenade him.  Now move to 
the far right side of the screen.  Then head up.  A lot of coward soldiers 
will appear but ignore them.  Keep moving up.  You'll see an arrow cannon to 
the left.  You'll also see a kamikaze soldier appear from the center.  
However, since you were at the far right side, he'll get himself caught 
against the rock in the water.  Now grenade him from a safe distance.  Then 
head up the rock's right side to avoid the arrows.  You'll see a self 
destruct soldier appear from the center.  Quickly run back and stand south of 
the rock when you see the soldier.  If done correctly, he will be caught 
against the rock where you can safely grenade him.

Stand against the far right side again and head up.  Another self destruct 
soldier will appear from the far right side.  Stop moving and just keep 
firing north at him.  You will kill him before he gets close enough to 
explode.  Continue going forward.  You'll soon encounter another self 
destruct soldier.  This one approaches from the left side.  Adjust your aim, 
stop, wait, and fire away.  You should be able to take him out.  Then head up 
the middle.  You'll see a tank to the left and a gun turret in the middle.  
Destroy the gun turret first.  Get the bullets it leaves.  Then enter the 
tank and go across the suspension bridge.  Keep firing as you go.  You'll 
take out two red soldiers who drop an L and an F behind.  Don't stop moving 
as you go across the bridge because it is rigged with two homing sensors that 
detonate soon after you activate them.  You'll now be facing a lot of blue 
soldiers and red soldiers.  Some of the blue soldiers are grenade soldiers 
and some are kamikaze soldiers so fire away at them all.  Shoot the ones far 
away while you move left or right to dodge the grenades.  Run over the ones 
closer to you.  The red soldiers will drop an L and an F each.  Head up and 
you'll see red fortress walls.  This means you're almost at the end of area 
1.  Don't get careless now.  Take out the fortress guards on both sides.  
Then head up to the gate and kill the guards around the gate.  Destroy the 
gate to find fuel.  Head up through it.


Gate 6
======
You'll see another gate and another fortress guard.  A brown tank lies in 
wait behind the gate but it can't reach you.  You can reach it though.  First 
take out the guard by standing against the south gate wall and tossing a 
grenade at him.  Then destroy the gate for some grenades.  Now stand against 
the north fortress wall and toss a grenade at the tank.  It will reach the 
tank and destroy it.  Now head up.  There are two more fortress guards and 
another gate.  Take out the right guard first.  Then kill the left one.  Take 
out the gate last.  Head up and you'll see another guard, another gate, and 
another brown tank.  However, this tank is armed with missiles meaning that 
it can hit you over the wall.  You'll need to be extra careful.  I suggest 
moving to the left side and taking out the tank first.  Then kill the 
fortress guard.  Take out the gate last.  Get the bullets it leaves behind.  
Head up to find yet another gate and another pair of fortress guards.  Take 
them out like usual and head on up through the gate.

A gun turret blocks your path.  Clear it away with some grenades or tank 
shots.  Then head up.  Another gate and three fortress guards stand in your 
way.  Kill the lower left guard first.  Then take out the ones around the 
gate.  Destroy the gate.  Now look to the right and you should spot a patch 
of grass below the right wall.  Shoot that patch to find a hidden heart.  
This heart will let you retain your powerups after one death.  Now go through 
the gate and pick up the fuel on the way.  You'll face fortress guards on 
both sides.  To the north are two stationary shooters.  If you have a tank 
then simply stay in the direct center of the area and run up to the end of 
the level.  Don't worry about the gate.  Just run through it with the tank.  
You'll escape the explosion.  If you are not in the dead center of the area 
then the fortress guards on either side will be able to hit you with their 
grenades.

If you don't have a tank then it will be a lot harder to pass this area.  
You'll want to take out the two stationary shooters.  Doing so requires a hit 
and run tactic.  We'll take out the left one first.  What you will be doing 
is to stand next to his firing path, run up, and grenade him.  As you run up, 
the left guard will toss a grenade at you.  Your grenade should have been 
tossed before the guard tossed his.  Now you'll turn away from the fortress 
guard and run away to avoid the grenade explosion.  You will get away if you 
had perfect timing.  This is not easy to do so don't be surprised if you die.  
Now that you know what to do, here's how to do it.  First, look at the mines 
rigged in front of the gate to the north.  You'll see three mines.  Stand 
under the center mine.  Now study the left stationary shooter's firing range 
and note the safe spot between the center and right bullet streams.  You are 
going to move in a circle going clockwise from the spot you are at now.  
Throw your grenade during this clockwise movement.  You should be able to hit 
the shooter with your grenade and escape the wrath of the left fortress 
guard.

Now let's deal with the other stationary shooter.  Stand to the left of his 
center line of fire.  Now you will move up in an counterclockwise circle.  
Toss your grenade during this movement.  You should be able to take out the 
shooter and escape the right fortress guard's grenade explosion.  Now that 
the opposition is dead, just stay in the center of the area and head up.  
You'll activate a homing sensor.  Toss a grenade at the gate and then retreat 
to avoid the missile that comes.  The missile will hit very soon so get back.  
Then head up through the gate to finish area 1 and get 10,000 bonus points.  
You should have 100,000 points or more if you didn't continue yet.



                       ##############################
                       ##          Area 2          ##
                       ##############################

Start
=====
You'll begin area 2 without any powerups unless you grabbed a heart from area 
1.  If you didn't have a heart when you finished area 1, then say goodbye to 
your powerups.  If you did grab a heart, you will keep everything but you'll 
lose everything if you die once.  Therefore, proceed carefully until you find 
another heart.  If you had nothing when you finished the last mission, then 
the loss isn't so bad but still be on guard as you proceed.

You'll be in the center of a rock formation.  Head up and you'll see a brown 
tank.  It will approach you from near the center of the passage.  Grenade it 
and move on.  You'll fight another tank that appears close to the center.  
Destroy it and stand on the path that the tank was moving along.  Then take a 
few steps forward.  You'll encounter a red soldier that appears on the same 
path as the last brown tank.  Kill him to get an L.  Continue forward and 
you'll fight a handful of regular soldiers.  Kill them or avoid them.  Then 
keep moving along.  You can destroy the doorways of the buildings on either 
side for points but that is up to you.  Now get ready.  Two red soldiers will 
appear from the center as you pass by the doorways of the buildings.  Killing 
both of them will not be necessary because they each drop B's.  Just kill the 
one closest to you.  Watch out for their shots because they will kill you if 
you aren't prepared.  Now head up and you'll see two missile soldiers 
guarding a gun turret.  Do not approach or even get near the left one because 
he is a homing missile soldier.  He fires missiles that chase after you and 
are almost impossible to outrun.  He will fire them only if you get near him 
so keep away.  B-grenade him if you have them otherwise just go to the right 
side and take out the regular missile soldier.  Then destroy the gun turret 
from an angle or stand to the right side and grenade from there.

Head forward and you'll change the homing missile soldier into a grenade 
soldier.  Now he is less of a threat so kill him.  Then get the bullets left 
by the gun turret.  Head up across the suspension bridge.  You'll face the 
usual coward soldiers as you head across.  Stay in the center of the bridge 
to avoid land mines.  You'll hear a "choop" sound as you get near the first 
mine.  That should clue you in on what you'll be facing next.  A super tank 
will appear as you pass the second mine.  Quickly move to one side to avoid 
its shot.  Then you'll notice four gray bars on the screen.  Stay below the 
bottom two gray bars and you won't get run over by the super tank.  Now just 
grenade away to destroy it.  Then continue forward across the bridge.  Stay 
on the right side of the bridge.  You'll soon activate a land mine on the 
left side of the bridge.  Keep moving up until you are directly to the right 
of the mine (or between the middle set of the bridge's suspension cables).  
Then an enemy chopper will appear left of the bridge.  Do not move and let it 
pass by you.  It will fire a round of shots at you but they will miss and the 
chopper will fly harmlessly by.

Now keep an eye on the last pair of bridge suspension cables (the gray wires 
connecting the wooden bridge and the long brown poles).  Another chopper will 
appear right as you get next to the last pair of cables.  Now that you know 
when it will appear, here's how to defeat it.  Just toss a grenade right as 
you pass the cables.  It should land square on the chopper if you threw it at 
the right moment.  Now head up and you'll see two soldiers underwater rushing 
towards you.  B-grenades will serve you well here if you have them.  Kill the 
left one first because he is a self destruct soldier.  Then quickly kill the 
right one because he is a kamikaze soldier.  Ignore the fake red soldier.  
Now stand above the left gray bar.  Then look at the top edge of the ground.  
You'll notice that it is primarily flat and then it curves inward at the far 
left side.  Shoot the ground south of this curve to uncover a hidden knife.

Now head into the water.  Stay in the center of the screen.  You'll face some 
regular soldiers.  You'll soon see a soldier approaching you from beneath the 
water.  He is a self destruct soldier but since you were already in the 
center of the screen, killing him should be easy.  Keep heading down the 
center.  You'll come across a red soldier that appears in the center.  Shoot 
him to get an L.  Then you'll see a bunker to the left.  Head over to it and 
grenade it.  It leaves bullets and grenades behind.  Now you'll be on dry 
land again.  Follow it as it winds to the right side.  There are some green 
trees on the right side.  Stand next to them and head up.  Keep your eyes on 
the green patch of grass (it's bigger than the smaller green spots) above 
you.  A green tank will attack you as you pass the green patch.  Head back to 
it as the tank appears.  That spot is safe from the tank's shots.  Now 
destroy the tank with a grenade and then head up.

Skip the first wooden bridge because there's a homing sensor placed at the 
bridge's left end.  You'll see two blockades.  Destroy them both to get 
bullets, grenades, and fuel.  A red soldier will appear as you get the items.  
He is the most dangerous foe in the immediate area because of his firing 
rate.  He drops an F.  Some of the soldiers in the river are kamikaze 
soldiers so take them out.  You'll know it's them because of their erratic 
walking pattern.  Hopefully you still have the knife powerup from earlier.  
Kill them off and go to the right side before you head up.  A chopper appears 
on the left side.  It can't reach you so move along.  Keep going up and 
you'll see a soldier swimming towards you under the water.  He's a self 
destruct soldier so I recommend that you stop moving once you see him.  Then 
turn, aim, and keep firing.  Doing this will improve your chances of killing 
him.  Now take a few steps over to the left so that you're not directly 
against the far right edge of the screen.  Head up and another self destruct 
soldier appears.  You won't have much time to kill him so I hope that your 
aim is good.

Continue forward and you'll see a red soldier.  Just watch out for his shots 
and grenade or shoot him.  He'll drop a B behind.  Keep heading north and 
you'll fight another self destruct soldier.  You should be very familiar with 
the tactics used to defeat him by now which is to simply kill him as quickly 
as possible.  If you haven't already noticed, there is more than one angle 
that you can fire at when you face diagonally.  There is the typical 45 
degree shot and a steeper 60 degree shot.  Being able to adjust quickly for 
each will be a lifesaver.  Hopefully you haven't moved too far up that you 
can see a soldier on the fortress wall to the left.  If so, then you should 
be able to see the start of the fortress wall to the left.  If you don't see 
it, then move up slowly until you do.  Eventually you should be able to spot 
pipes on the right side of the wall.  Stand directly south of these pipes and 
head up.  You'll see what appears to be a fortress guard.  However, he is not 
a fortress guard.  No, he's more dangerous because he's an FL soldier.  
What's an FL soldier?  Well, FL soldiers are equipped with F and L powerups 
so their shots are red like yours after you grab the F powerup and long-range 
thanks to the L powerup.  Don't worry about the F powerup that these soldiers 
have because it only takes 1 shot to kill you anyway.  Tanks are able to stop 
these bullets so the F powerup does them no good in that case.  The good news 
is that the firing rate of FL soldiers is slow and they only fire single 
shots at a time.  Since you stood under the pipes, you will be safe from his 
line of fire.  Simply get within grenade range and let him have it.

Then head up to find a gate.  The usual fortress guards will be around the 
gate.  Take them down first.  Then destroy the gate.  Get the bullets left 
behind and head up.  You will see another fortress guard on the wall to the 
north.  Kill him and then turn left until you are facing the left side.  
You'll see a path that looks like a dead end.  Shoot the ground to uncover 
some gold bars.  Gold bars give you 5,000 extra points so get it and then 
destroy the gate to the right.  It leaves grenades behind.  Head up and kill 
the right fortress guard.  Then head left but stay as far to the south along 
the south fortress wall to avoid getting grenaded by the other fortress 
guard.  Watch out for a land mine in the middle.  Take out the guard and the 
gate afterward.  You'll get some bullets.


Gate 1
======
Head up and you'll face a macho man (he swings a club).  His only attack is 
to run around and hit you.  He takes one B-grenade or two regular grenades to 
kill.  You can also fire 10 F bullets at him as well.  It's hard to hit him 
with two grenades so unless you have B-grenades I recommend avoiding him.  
You will face two red soldiers afterwards.  They drop an F and L 
respectively.  Continue up and you'll face a stationary shooter on the right 
side.  You can just stay out of his way but killing him will make the next 
part easier.  Head up and you'll face a brown tank.  You'll also see a tank 
that you can use on the left side.  Killing the brown tank will be easy if 
you took out the stationary shooter.

Now head up and you'll see another tank that you can take for a total of two 
tanks.  You'll also see a stone face by the tanks.  As you can imagine, 
destroying the stone face will trigger a chain reaction that will destroy 
both tanks.  So how do you get the tanks?  Well, you only need one so you'll 
be taking the top tank.  Just stay on the far left side and head up.  The 
arrows from the face will all miss.  Now enter the top tank.  Then move a 
safe distance from the face if you are going to destroy either it or the tank 
below so that you yourself don't get caught in the subsequent explosion.  
Then head up and you'll see more stone faces.  There are four altogether.  
Destroy them all but don't get caught in their explosions.  Continue forward 
and you'll notice light colored spots in the ground.  If you don't then 
you're probably not in a tank because these spots will only prevent tanks 
from moving forward.  These "spots" are marshes.  What you need to do here is 
to maneuver your tank around the marshes.  A good way to do this is to move 
up and along the far left rock.  Then head across the bridge.  Shoot the 
southwest corner of the center rock after you cross the bridge to uncover a 
gold clock.  This item adds 2,000 points to your total.

Now head up by going through the two rocks farthest to the left.  You'll see 
a fortress guard.  I suggest getting out of the tank (if you have one) and 
killing him on foot to save fuel.  There are three paths to choose from.  All 
lead to the same place but tanks can only use the right path so take that 
path if you're in a tank.  The marshes can be tricky to get through but keep 
trying until you get past them.  You will see another fortress guard halfway 
up the right path.  Kill him before you go any further.  Then head up and 
you'll see two fortress guards, one on each side.  Kill the right one first.  
Then go to the left and take out the one there.  Now stand against the left 
fortress wall.  Then fire north to uncover a hidden heart.  This item lets 
you retain all of your powerups after you die but for one death only.  
Destroy the gate but be on guard for the homing sensor placed in front of the 
gate.  Quickly head up and grab the fuel left behind.  Head through the gate 
and fire away.


Gate 2
======
The next area is full of grenade soldiers.  There are two red soldiers and a 
macho man as well.  The red soldiers drop an F and a B.  If you kill the 
macho man, the resulting explosion will kill off a red soldier.  Focus on 
killing the red soldiers first.  Then take out the grenade soldiers.  
Avoiding the macho man is the least important thing to worry about here.  Now 
head up and kill the grenade soldiers.  You'll now come across some canopy.  
You should spot 5 "notches" in the southern part of the canopy.  Shoot the 
canopy on the right next to the second notch from the left to uncover a 
hidden triple shot (looks like 3 dots).  This lets you fire three shots out 
at once.  However, it can not be upgraded so do not get it unless you have no 
powerups already.  Now shoot the canopy north of the second notch from the 
right to find a hidden heart.  Then head up.  You'll face regular soldiers.  
Then you'll see a river running horizontally.  Two red soldiers come out and 
attack.  They drop a B and F behind.  Go across the bridge.  You'll see 
something flashing under the canopy to the north.  That flashing object is a 
tank that you can use.  Since it is a fresh tank, it will have max fuel so I 
suggest that you switch tanks to get a full tank of gas.

Head north until you see some walls.  This next area is full of walls that 
block your path.  Fortunately, these walls that block your path can be 
destroyed with a grenade.  It is pretty obvious where most are.  The center 
path to your north is blocked by a wall.  You can destroy this wall by 
grenading it.  The wall will drop fuel behind.  Now go up the middle path 
until you hit the next wall.  Face left and fire at the far left shadows.  
You'll uncover a hidden gold box.  It adds 1,000 points to your score.  Now 
the wall to the right is blocking the path so destroy it.  Just be careful 
not to get hit by the grenade soldier on the other side.  Then head up 
through the right path.  Your progress forward will soon be stopped by a long 
wall that runs halfway across the screen.  Notice how the left edge of the 
wall is slanted?  Well that should tip you off that the right side can be 
grenaded.  This is the case sure enough.

Head up and another equally long wall blocks your path.  Grenade the center 
of this wall to create an opening through.  Now you have two choices here.  
You can take the right path by going through the opening that you just 
created or take the left path that is already visible.  I'll take the right 
path because it is safer.  Head through the opening and fire at the shadows 
under the triangular shaped wall to the north to find some hidden gold bars.  
Although we took the right path, there is a hidden knife on the left path.  
There are two triangle shaped walls connected to each other in the center.  
Notice the two small spots of shadow in between these walls?  The knife is 
found left of the left shadow.  As a word of caution for those taking the 
left path, there is a homing sensor placed by the shadows under the top left 
wall.  You'll now find yourself at a wall that spans the entire width of the 
screen.  The weak spot is in the center.  You'll get fuel afterwards.  The 
next wall has weak spots on the far left and far right sides.  Turn right and 
shoot the shadows to find a girl.  This girl is Little Athena, a character 
from another SNK game, Athena.  All she does is add 2,500 points to your 
score.

Now go to the far left side of the wall.  Head up and shoot the shadows above 
you to find a hidden heart.  Go right and watch out for the land mine.  You 
can walk or move the tank around it.  There are probably several soldiers 
stuck against the wall above you.  You should have noticed the ones that are 
grenade soldiers.  The ones not firing are kamikaze soldiers.  Kill them all 
before heading up.  You'll see a tank on the right side.  Get it if you need 
a fresh tank of gas or if you don't already have one.  Head up and you'll be 
attacked by several grenade soldiers.  If you want to save the tank, you can 
always kill the soldiers on foot first and then get back in the tank.  There 
is a homing sensor placed in the narrowest part of the grass.  Continue 
forward and you'll face a gun turret.  Destroy it and move on.  You'll now 
face two brown tanks on opposite sides of the river.  Take out the right one 
first.  Ignore the left one.

You'll see a soldier in the middle of the wooden bridge.  Stay away from him 
because he is a homing missile soldier.  Beyond the bridge is a bunker.  You 
can avoid the homing missile soldier by going to either side of the screen.  
The bunker makes the right side a little more difficult route to take but you 
should still have the tank with you so pass the soldier until he becomes a 
grenade soldier.  Then take him out like usual.  Destroy the bunker to get 
bullets and grenades.  Head forward and you'll see two red soldiers.  They 
both drop B's behind.  Now stand above the wooden bridge so that you're in 
the water.  Turn left and fire at the ground to find a hidden knife.  Now 
head up.  You'll see three arrow cannons by the fortress gate.  Take your 
time passing each one.  Destroy the gate for some fuel.  Then head up.


Gate 3
======
You'll now be attacked by a lot of red soldiers.  There are four altogether.  
They drop two F's and two L's between them.  There is a lot of marsh so 
you'll have to really twist and turn to get your tank (if you have one) 
through.  Keep going forward and you'll find a bunker.  You can skip this one 
by moving along the far left side.  It has bullets and grenades but they're 
not worth it.  Just be careful of a homing missile placed to the left of the 
bunker.  Head up and you'll see two flame thrower soldiers.  Kill them both.  
Now look to the right side.  You should see an opening between the trees.  
Shoot that opening to find an H.  It will fully restore all of you ammo as 
well as giving you 200 fuel for your tank.  Now destroy the gun turret to the 
north for some grenades.  Destroy the other gun turret behind it to get 
bullets.  Get to the far right side by the trees and fire north to find a 
hidden heart.

Head up and you'll face two macho men.  Avoiding them is going to be very 
difficult so I hope you have a tank, B-grenades, or a knife.  If you do have 
to avoid them, I suggest that you use the rock in the center as a shield of 
sorts.  It will help to separate the macho men from each other.  Continue 
onward and you'll be at the foot of a suspension bridge.  You'll hear the 
familiar "choop" sound as you approach.  Stand to one side as you head up the 
bridge.  You'll be attacked by a super tank.  Take it out like normal with 
your grenades.  Continue ahead but watch out for two land mines placed near 
the middle of the bridge.  You'll fight four red soldiers next.  They drop 
two L's and two S's.  Now keep moving ahead to fight a chopper.  Destroy it 
only if you're not in a tank.  Otherwise, just keep moving because you're 
most likely running low on tank fuel.  You'll fight a second chopper 
afterwards.  Repeat the same strategy from before.  Keep going ahead and 
you'll face a third chopper.  Deal with it like before.  Then you'll approach 
the end of the first bridge.  You'll hear a "choop" sound again.  Head up to 
face a super tank.  Your tank should be making the ringing noise indicating 
that you are low on fuel at this point.  Ignore it and keep going.  You'll be 
able to kill the next two red soldiers.  They leave an F and a B behind.

Get out of the tank now if you haven't already done so.  Then head up to find 
a blockade.  Destroy it for some bullets.  Now stand in between the two gray 
bars.  Turn left and shoot the left gray bar to find a hidden heart.  Then 
head up to fight a macho man.  Try not to scroll the screen any further until 
you pass this macho man because a second one will appear if you scroll up too 
much.  Move up after you pass the first macho man to fight a second one.  
Head up after you pass the second macho man and you'll see two buildings.  
Stand next to the right building's left side.  Stop moving when you see a 
green tank appear.  Do not move the screen up until you destroy this tank.  
Then you should see a patch of grass in the center.  Stand to the right of 
this patch and move up to fight a second green tank.  Destroy it before you 
move up any more.  Now stand under the patch of grass and toss a grenade as 
you head up.  It should land on and destroy a third green tank.  Now stand 
against the left building and kill the stationary shooter.  Then head up.  
Another green tank rushes out.  You'll be safe if you stayed against the left 
building.  Destroy the tank and keep moving.  You'll see a stationary shooter 
on the right.  Kill him.

Then move up but don't stand in the center.  Stay a little to the right of 
the center as you head up.  You'll fight a brown tank.  Destroy it and move 
up to fight another brown tank.  Destroy this one too.  Now pass the right 
building until you see the top of it.  Turn right and shoot the ground above 
the right building to find a triple shot.  Unless you have no other gun 
powerups I don't advise getting it because it removes all the other gun 
powerups that you have.  Now stand against the left building and shoot up to 
find some super speed (SS).  This item will make you move faster which makes 
surviving the water areas a whole lot easier.  The next part will involve 
several self destruct soldiers so I recommend that you retreat back after you 
see them.  Fighting them on land eliminates the protection that they get 
while underwater.  Now a self destruct soldier will appear near the right 
side as you approach the water.  Kill him quickly.  Then slowly head up.  
Another self destruct soldier comes at you from the center.  Kill him and 
then move up.  Retreat back a little because two submerged soldiers come at 
you.  The left one is a self destruct soldier while the right one is a 
kamikaze soldier.  Both are dangerous so it doesn't matter who you kill 
first.

Now go across the water.  You'll soon come across a bunker and two red 
soldiers.  They both drop B's.  The bunker has bullets and grenades but 
they're not worth it unless you really need them.  Just steer clear of the 
bunker by going around the right side of the rock in the water.  This will 
help to jam the land mines that are chasing you.  The red soldier to the 
right side is a fake.  You'll now see a red soldier approaching from the 
left.  He drops an F.  Now stand directly north of the rock as you go up.  
You'll fight a kamikaze soldier.  He'll be in your line of fire if you were 
above the rock as you moved up.  Get on the island and you'll see a red 
soldier and a self destruct soldier coming towards you.  The red soldier 
drops an L.  Take out the red soldier first since he's closer.  Then quickly 
kill the self destruct soldier afterwards.  Keep moving ahead and you'll see 
another red soldier.  He drops an F behind.  Now go to the far left side.  
Stand one body width away from the edge and head up.  You'll encounter an FL 
soldier on the fortress wall.  Kill him and then stand next to the shadows of 
the left fortress wall as you head up.  The left fortress guard is actually 
another FL soldier.  Get within grenade range and kill him.  You want to keep 
him firing directly south so don't get too close or he will start firing 
diagonally at you.  Now the right soldier is a fortress guard so take him out 
like usual.  Then destroy the gate if you haven't already done so.  It leaves 
fuel behind.  Shoot the ground below the wall to the right of the gate to 
find a triple shot.  Go through the gate now.


Gate 4
======
Go north until you reach some walls.  Shoot the ground left of the left 
shadows to find an H.  Now go up the right path and shoot the shadow in 
between the wall to find a gold heart.  This item is the ultimate in 
powerups.  It gives you the B, F, L, S, heart, knife, and super speed 
powerups as well as fully recharging your ammo.  Go up and you'll see two 
paths.  Take the right one and you'll see a large area of shadow.  Shoot the 
left half of it to find a hidden heart.  Then go all the way to the left side 
where you see two triangular shaped walls connected to each other.  Fire at 
the shadow on the left side of the walls to find a triple shot.  Head up a 
little and you'll have a left and right path to choose from.  Take the right 
path because the left path has a homing sensor that will kill you.  Head up 
until you see two triangular shaped walls connected to each other on the 
screen.  A fake red soldier will be above the left wall.  An FL soldier will 
be standing right next to him.  To the right will be a kamikaze soldier.  
Keep your eyes focused entirely on the FL soldier.  Watch his shots and get 
out of their way while you kill the kamikaze soldier.  Stand below the right 
edge of the left wall.  You will also have a clear shot at the FL soldier 
from here.  Kill him and then fire down the middle of the center path.  
You'll uncover a hidden knife.

Be careful as you go down the center path to get the knife because a homing 
sensor is placed in the middle.  Just run up the center path until you hit 
the wall above.  Then turn right and fire.  You'll uncover a hidden gold box 
at the bottom of the right path.  Then head up the right path.  Some regular 
soldiers will be running around.  Just hide behind the walls for cover.  Then 
you'll see a large wall with a large area of shadow below it.  Go around the 
right side of the wall.  Stand against the wall to your north.  Turn left and 
fire to uncover an SS.  You'll now have two paths to choose from.  The left 
path has a hidden triple shot and a homing sensor.  The triple shot can be 
found by shooting spot above the homing sensor.  The right path is the safer 
of the two.  Grab the SS that you uncovered and head through the right path.  
You'll now see a wall spanning the screen.  Grenade the center to find an 
opening and some bullets.  Then face left and shoot the shadows to the left 
of the newly created opening to find a hidden heart.  Now there should be 
some grenade soldiers stuck against the wall to the north.  Kill them first 
and then head through the opening.  Then go around the wall from the left 
side.  Kill any grenade soldiers that appear.  A red soldier will appear 
above you.  He drops an F behind.  There should be some more grenade soldiers 
jammed to your right.  Kill them while they're still jammed.

Head up and two more red soldiers appear from the right side.  They both have 
L's.  Go up.  I hope you have a knife because having one makes the next part 
very easy.  If you have a knife, then just keep running up and skip this next 
paragraph.  For those without knives, read on.  You'll now fight scorpions.  
These pesky enemies will rush at you and run circles around you.  Their 
method of attack is to run right into you like the kamikaze soldiers.  
Although they don't run straight for you, they will still walk into you from 
any direction.  Therefore it's best to avoid any sticky situations by 
shooting them as they get near you.  Stay in the center and keep heading up.  
Watch out for land mines scattered about.  The scorpions will soon be 
replaced by killer bees.  These insects don't fire at you but they can fly at 
you very quickly and (pardon the pun) make a beeline straight for you.  Well, 
actually they fly down and then fly diagonally backwards before flying down 
at you again.  You can think of their flight pattern resembling an "N" and a 
reverse "N" shape.  This isn't dangerous except that they can hit you during 
their diagonal flight.  Shoot them only if they are coming straight down at 
you or are at a distance from you.  It's far safer to walk out of their 
flight path if they are closer to you because it's very hard to hit them at 
that range.  Just try your best to keep moving ahead.  You can always try to 
wait out the bees, but this usually results in the missiles being fired.

You'll now reach some water and fight soldiers again.  There will be a slow 
moving soldier among the ones that appear.  That one is a self destruct 
soldier so take him out fast.  As you get near the land's edge, a kamikaze 
soldier will greet you from beneath the water.  Retreat and kill him on land 
where he loses the water advantage.  Head up and you'll see a self destruct 
soldier swimming towards you.  Run back and kill him as you gets out of the 
water.  Now stand in the center of the screen and fire up into the water.  
You'll uncover an hidden SS.  Get it and then stay one body length away from 
the left side of the screen.  Keep going up until you see purple fortress 
walls.  This is the final part of this mission.  First, you will see two 
soldiers and a tank that you can use.  The left one on the wall is an FL 
soldier.  The right one is a missile soldier.  If you took my advice and 
stayed on the left side, then you will be in perfect position to take out the 
FL soldier.  Then head east and take out the missile soldier.  Now do not 
enter the tank yet.  First take out the fortress guard by the gate.  Now 
before you enter the tank, please try your best to keep it intact because 
finishing this last part is a lot more difficult without a tank.  With that 
in mind, enter the tank and destroy the gate to find some fuel.  Stay on the 
right side of the gate as you head up.


Gate 5
======
To your north is another FL soldier.  His shots will not affect your tank.  
Kill him and then turn your aim left.  Fire to uncover a hidden triple shot.  
Now you have three paths to choose from.  However, only the right path will 
let a tank through.  You'll need to zigzag around the marsh in an "S" pattern 
to get past the marsh.  You'll see a fortress guard to your north.  Just kill 
him and move up.  A green tank appears and moves sideways.  It fires missiles 
so hiding behind the fortress walls will not help here.  Unless you have the 
F and L powerups, I strongly suggest that you get out of your tank and 
destroy the enemy tank on foot.  This will not only keep your tank safe, but 
also help to conserve fuel.  Move the screen up a little after you destroy 
the tank.  Do not move it up too far or you'll lose your tank.  Now another 
green tank appears past the gate above you.  It is also equipped with 
missiles.  Destroy it on foot and then take out the gate.  Then get back in 
your tank.  Head through the gate and two soldiers on the wall await you.  
The left one is an FL soldier while the right one is a fortress guard.  Take 
out the fortress guard first.  Then turn your aim right and shoot the ground 
to the right to find a hidden knife.  Now go left and take out the FL 
soldier.  Your tank will provide cover against his shots.  Then destroy the 
gate for some grenades.  Unless you found fuel from the green tanks, you will 
need to hurry.

Keep to the right side of the gate and go on through.  You'll see some 
marshes and four red soldiers.  They drop two F's and two L's.  Ignore the 
red soldiers unless you really need the F and the L.  Focus on getting past 
the marsh as quickly as possible.  This is accomplished by moving up until 
you are on top of the far left rock.  Then move right and up again to get 
around the rock to the bridge.  Head up through the opening between the two 
rocks farthest to the left until you get stopped by a marsh.  Now move left 
and up to get around this marsh.  Then go right and you'll be in front of an 
FL soldier.  Kill him and then you'll see that you have three paths to choose 
from.  Unfortunately, only the right path allows tanks to pass through so 
take that path.  You'll need to do the same "S" shaped movements to get by 
the marsh.  You'll also fight another fortress guard as you head through this 
way.  Kill him and head through the opening until you bump against the right 
fortress wall with pipes on its left side.

There are four soldiers altogether here.  The left and right soldiers are 
each fortress guards.  You should have already noticed that the two in the 
center are both FL soldiers.  Now you see why having a tank makes this part 
easy.  First, kill the right fortress guard.  Then go left and down until 
you're in the center path.  Then turn your aim north and fire to uncover a 
hidden heart.  Now do not go left to kill the other fortress guard because 
there is a land mine to the left that your tank can't get past.  Therefore, 
just hug the right fortress wall and head up.  The FL soldiers' bullets will 
be ineffective against your tank.  Get next to them and let them both have a 
taste of your shots.  Then destroy the gate from a safe distance for some 
fuel.  Watch out for a homing sensor placed in front of the gate.  Hug the 
right wall as you head on up through gate to finish area 2 and get 20,000 
bonus points.  You should now have over 200,000 points if you haven't 
continued since the start of the game.



                       ##############################
                       ##          Area 3          ##
                       ##############################

Start
=====
You'll begin area 3 without any powerups unless you grabbed a heart from area 
2.  If you didn't have a heart when you finished area 2, then say goodbye to 
your powerups.  If you did grab a heart, you will keep everything but you'll 
lose everything if you die once.  Therefore, proceed carefully until you find 
another heart.  If you had nothing when you finished the last mission, then 
the loss isn't so bad but still be on guard as you proceed.

You're now indoors.  A lot of stuff is gray so get used to this drab color.  
Bunkers and other objects will now be colored differently.  You'll face some 
new enemies here as well.  Head up and you'll fight a red soldier.  He leaves 
an F behind.  To your north is a bunker.  Watch out for the homing sensor 
that's placed directly south of the bunker.  Stand southeast of the right 
steel drum to get protected from the bunker's shots.  Then grenade it to get 
fuel and bullets.  Go through the gap between the drum and the right wall to 
avoid the homing sensor.  Continue forward and you'll see a fortress guard in 
the center.  Two red soldiers will be on both sides.  The left soldier drops 
a B while the right one drops an F.  Take the left path and you'll see a tank 
that you can take.  Behind it is a brown tank.  This tank is placed to lure 
you in to your death.  Instead of getting the tank, you will be destroying 
it.  Then destroy the brown tank afterwards.

Head up and you'll see another tank that you can take.  Shoot the oil drum 
next to the tank to find a hidden knife.  Then kill the red soldier for a B.  
Now enter the tank.  Head up but watch out for the homing sensor above the 
oil drum.  Stay in the center as you head up.  You'll see a green tank 
appear.  As you headed up, you went under a steel catwalk.  As long as you 
stay just above this catwalk, you will be safe from the tank's shots.  Wait 
for an opportunity to attack and destroy the tank.  Now keep firing north as 
you head down the center.  You will destroy a second green tank that rushes 
out from the center.  Now turn your aim right and fire at the shadows to your 
right to uncover an SS.  Head up and you'll see two missile soldiers.  Kill 
both and continue onward.

You'll now see fake Pauls and fake Vinces.  These guys are nothing more than 
regular soldiers disguised to look like you.  One shot will take them down.  
Keep heading forward until you reach water.  A red soldier appears.  He drops 
an L.  Across the water is a yellow tank.  Destroy it.  Now you will find the 
part that is most annoying on this stage, stairs.  If you though moving in 
water was slow, wait until you try climbing stairs.  The first step takes the 
longest and leaves you vulnerable to enemy fire.  Your best bet is to have 
the super speed (SS) powerup which makes navigating the stairs more 
tolerable.  Head across the stairs and you'll encounter another red soldier.  
He drops an S behind.  Many of the soldiers will be kamikaze soldiers so I 
hope you still have the knife from earlier.  The good news is that they won't 
shoot you.  You'll soon fight two more red soldiers from the right side.  
They drop an L and S behind.

A yellow tank will be attacking you from across the water.  Grenade it and 
then go across.  Avoid the land mine because it can kill you as you're 
climbing stairs.  Head up and there will be many yellow tanks on both sides.  
Fortunately, they aren't operational.  You will be attacked by a yellow tank 
coming down the center though.  A homing sensor will also be placed around 
the center to avoid it.  Destroy the tank and head up.  A second yellow tank 
should be attacking from the right side.  Grenade it and move on up to fight 
a third yellow tank from the left side.  Destroy it and then look at the 
floor.  You should see yellow pipes.  Look for the pipes that form a square.  
It is found in the center of the screen, along the same horizontal line that 
the third yellow tank was following.  Now above the square should be more 
yellow pipes.  Shoot the pipes above the square pipes to find a hidden triple 
shot.  A yellow tank should be attacking you from the right side now.  
Destroy it and then look at the stationary tanks on the left side.  You 
should see some gray floor tiles running between two of them.  Shoot those 
gray tiles between the tanks to find a hidden SS.  The super speed will be 
the most useful powerup in this mission so try not to lose it too soon.

Now head up and you'll see some of the stationary tanks on both sides firing 
at you.  Upon closer examination, there are only two stationary yellow tanks 
that are actually firing.  Destroy them both.  Watch out for a homing sensor 
placed in the center.  Head up and you'll see a red soldier.  He drops a B.  
Now to the north are some bullets across the water.  The bullets are guarded 
by a stationary shooter behind them.  There is also a kamikaze soldier in the 
center to make things more interesting.  Getting the bullets is your choice.  
I prefer not to get them because climbing the stairs sets you up for an easy 
death by the land mine.  I choose to go up the left side and avoid the entire 
mess altogether.  So go up the left side and kill the kamikaze soldier as he 
gets on land.  Now you should be above the triangle wall to the left.  Turn 
left and shoot the floor pipes to find a hidden heart.  Then you need to 
hurry across the water to the north because the land mine will kill you while 
you climb.  If the mine is too close then kill the stationary shooter to the 
right and lure the mine away before you cross the water.

There will be grenades on the other side.  Head up the left side of the green 
piping.  You'll see a self destruct soldier in the water to the right.  He is 
unable to climb the stairs and since you are behind the green pipe, his shots 
can't hit you.  Give him a taste of your grenades.  Then head up and a 
kamikaze soldier appears.  You can retreat back behind the pipes for cover 
and kill him afterwards.  Then get the grenades.  Go up along the left side 
and you'll see some green piping in the center.  In the middle of the green 
pipes are yellow pipes.  Get over to the center by climbing up the sides of 
the stairs.  The land mine will be your biggest threat here because it will 
kill you if you don't move far enough away from it before you climb.  Shoot 
the top of the yellow pipes to find a hidden SS.  Now walk along the left 
side of the center island.  To the north on the left side will be a red 
soldier.  He drops a B.  To the right are two soldiers stuck against the 
green piping.  The top one is a kamikaze soldier while the bottom one is a 
self destruct soldier.  Kill them both before you move up.

To the north is a missile soldier.  Two red soldiers will be approaching from 
the water.  They both carry F's.  Now a self destruct soldier will be rushing 
down the center of the water.  Kill him quickly.  Behind him is a kamikaze 
soldier.  Then head up along the left side and you'll see a green soldier run 
down the center.  Kill him for a K.  Then get it.  Now there are several 
small islands to the north.  An FL soldier is sitting on top of the center 
island.  You'll need to kill him quickly if you didn't already do so with the 
K.  Ignore the fake red soldier because he's not a threat.  Kill the FL 
soldier quickly because behind him are two underwater soldiers.  The left one 
is a self destruct soldier while the right one is a kamikaze soldier.  You 
definitely do not want to engage them all at once.  If you do have to fight 
them all, I suggest that you retreat back and take out the self destruct 
soldier, kamikaze soldier, and FL soldier in that order.  Having the super 
speed will allow you to move just as fast as the self destruct and kamikaze 
soldiers.

You'll see three equally shaped islands.  Go up through the left and middle 
islands.  Turn left when you get to the end of the water and are at the foot 
of the stairs spanning the entire screen.  Fire at the water to the left to 
find a hidden gold heart at the far left side.  This little item should give 
you the edge you need to win if you don't already have all the powers it 
gives you.  Now head up the stairs and you'll see a bunker to the right.  
Next to it are two tanks for the taking.  Here's how to get the tank safely.  
First, you should see two drums on the left side.  Get under them so that 
you're now left of the tank and bunker.  Turn right and fire at the bunker.  
Your F bullets will destroy it.  The bunker leaves bullets and grenades 
behind.  The tank will remain safe.  Now walk down and then right until you 
are directly south of the tank.  You should see a drum directly north of the 
tank.  Fire at that drum.  You will kill a oil drum soldier.  The tank next 
to him also gets destroyed by the explosion but you only need one tank 
anyway.  Now enter the tank and proceed.

Head down the center.  You'll soon see a homing missile soldier to the right 
side.  Quickly move back once you see him.  His range is very long and he can 
destroy your tank if you charge in there unprepared.  You should have the 
necessary firepower to kill him from a distance thanks to the gold heart from 
earlier.  If you don't, then head up the left side to avoid the soldier 
altogether.  Now you'll see a second homing missile soldier on the left side.  
Unless you have long range shots or B-grenades, you may have to sacrifice 
your tank in order to kill the soldier.  Head up after you kill them to find 
a skull door.  These doors will now replace the fortress gates of the last 
two missions.  They are still destroyed in the same way though.  The fortress 
guards are here and they are ready to kill you.  Take them both out before 
you destroy the door.  You'll get fuel for your tank.  Head under the gate 
but stop short of passing through.  Move up enough until you see your hair 
showing on the other side of the gate.  Then turn left and fire.  You'll 
uncover a hidden knife.


Gate 1
======
Now kill the red soldier on the screen for an L.  Head up and you'll see 
another red soldier.  He drops an L as well.  To your right is a yellow tank.  
Head over to destroy it.  Keep in mind that the dummy tanks will not provide 
you cover because this tank is firing missiles.  Then go up and kill the next 
red soldier for an S.  Then you will see another yellow tank moving across 
the top.  This tank fires regular shots so you can take refuge behind the 
other tanks if you need.  As you head up you will see green pipes and a lot 
of gray domes.  Your path is split into three parts.  The right path is 
suicide because of a homing missile placed along the path.  The center path 
is safe but it doesn't have any items.  The left path is the recommended one.  
The left path has three cones enclosed by green piping.  Look at the top two 
cones that are close together.  Look to their right side and you should see a 
small gray area.  Fire at that area to uncover hidden gold bars.  Then head 
up the left path.  Now look for the topmost cone.  Then stand to that cone's 
right side by going above it because there is a homing missile below the 
cone.  Fire at the yellow piping to the right and you'll uncover a hidden 
knife just above the green piping to the right.

Now you'll see pools of water.  There are several paths to take but I suggest 
sticking to the paths with floor tiles because you will move faster.  Falling 
into the pool will leave you a sitting duck for all the kamikaze soldiers in 
the area.  Stay on the floor tiles if you are in a tank because the tank will 
fall down the stairs very easily.  Tanks cannot climb stairs.  In fact, the 
only way to get back out of a pool after falling in is to back up and 
"climb" up spots where there are no steps.  I suggest taking the center path 
north until you see a homing sensor.  Then go right and you'll be under a 
rectangular pool.  Shoot one floor tile left of the center of the northern 
steps to find a hidden H.  To the north is a bunker.  Destroy it for bullets 
and grenades.  Then go up and you'll see a pool north of the bunker.  Shoot 
the left half of the water to find a hidden SS.  Now you should have already 
been attacked by three red soldiers.  If not, then just move up until you see 
them.  Ignore the right one because he is a fake.  The other two each drop 
B's behind.  Now do not take the center path because there is a land mine 
placed at the start of the path which is a pain for tanks to get around.  
Take the far right path instead.

You will see two homing missile soldiers as you approach the rectangular 
pool.  I hope you have long range shots or B-grenades or you will not get 
past these guys without dying.  Take them both out and then you will see two 
paths going north.  You should also see a pool with stairs that form a 
triangle in the middle of it.  If you are in a tank now, then I strongly 
recommend that you park the tank on the right path so that it is positioned 
to the right of the triangle steps.  Now get out and stand in the water so 
that you are directly to the right of these steps.  Then head up.  You will 
see two skull doors and three soldiers on top of the doors.  The left and 
right soldiers are fortress guards.  The center soldier is an FL soldier.  
You will be out of the FL soldier's line of fire if you are standing to the 
right of the triangle steps.  Now take out the soldier.  Then destroy the 
left skull door.  The right skull door is a fake and will not open if you 
grenade it.  Grenade it anyway for some points.  Since the right door is a 
fake, there is no need to kill the right fortress guard.  Just kill the left 
one.  Then get back in your tank if you got out and get the bullets and 
grenades from the skull door.  Head through.


Gate 2
======
You'll see two paths.  A red soldier comes out.  He drops a B.  Behind the 
soldier up on the catwalk is a moving cannon.  It fires missiles and moves 
around so you'll need to time your grenades.  Now head up the left side.  
Another red soldier comes at you.  He drops a B.  Two more red soldiers come 
out, but they are on the right side.  Both drop F's behind.  Now do not fire 
if you are in a tank or throw grenades if you are on foot.  To the north is a 
tank that you don't want to destroy by accident.  You probably are running 
low on fuel if you already have a tank.  Here's the perfect time to switch 
tanks (or grab a new one).  The red soldier to the left drops an L behind.  
You have two paths to take again.  Take the left side and head up.  Stop when 
you reach the second pool.  Go left so that you are standing south of the 
pool's water.  Face north and fire at the water.  A hidden gold clock will 
appear.  Continue ahead.  The red soldier on the right side dropped an L if 
you were curious.

Now you will have two paths to pick from again.  A moving cannon will run 
along the center and head right.  Take it out if you can.  Then take the left 
path.  You'll see a flame thrower soldier.  Just stay out of his line of fire 
and you'll be safe.  Take him out.  Then go left.  Above you on the wall is a 
fortress guard.  To north on the right are two more flame thrower soldiers.  
There's another tank that you can take.  The other soldiers stuck against the 
walls are grenade soldiers so kill them through the walls if you can.  Go up 
and you'll see another fortress guard.  Kill the soldier before entering the 
tank.  Now head up.  You'll see a green soldier running towards you.  Kill 
him and get the K that he drops.  Now the path will widen up and you should 
see three floor tiles lined up diagonally.  Stand on the bottom tile and turn 
left.  Fire at the ground to the left to find a hidden heart.

Go forward and you'll see black soldiers.  Treat them like regular soldiers.  
Now the area will be covered with catwalks making it hard to see.  Be careful 
passing under them because there is a land mine placed on the left and right 
sides.  Head up along the left wall to avoid all the mines.  A green tank 
will rush out at you from the left side as you approach the shadows of the 
walls to your north.  You will be safe if you say below the catwalk by the 
left wall.  Destroy the tank.  Then on the left wall above you is a fortress 
guard.  Take him down.  Then head up along the left wall.  You'll see another 
green tank.  This one will be moving diagonally on the right side.  Destroy 
this tank.  There is a fortress guard on the right wall but he is not a 
threat so continue forward down the center of the area to avoid the land 
mines.  Just don't get too close to the fortress guard on the right side.

You'll see a red soldier in the center.  He carries a B.  On both sides are 
fortress guards.  To the north in the center is a moving cannon.  Take out 
the left guard first.  Then destroy the cannon.  Kill the right guard last.  
Then head up but stay on the right side as much as possible.  You'll see a 
land mine at the top of the passageway and two missile soldiers.  The left 
one is a homing missile soldier while the right one is a regular missile 
soldier.  Staying as far to the right as possible will help you avoid the 
homing missiles.  Try to get as close to the right soldier without getting 
hit by his missiles.  Then kill the homing missile soldier.  Kill the other 
soldier afterwards.  You'll see a skull door to the north.  Two fortress 
guards will protect it.  Take them out and then the skull door.  You'll find 
fuel.  Now head on through the gate.


Gate 3
======
You'll find yourself in oil drum country.  Well, it's actually oil drum 
soldier country but who's counting?  This means that the area that you are 
now in is filled with oil drum soldiers.  Of course, not all the oil drums 
are oil drum soldiers but you won't be able to tell until you get close 
enough.  Take the initiative and just grenade all the oil drums.  This is 
more effective than running up to an oil drum and risk getting shot in the 
process.  Stick to the left side for fewer oil drum soldiers.  Now you'll see 
plenty of steps and only one path in the center.  Take the center path and 
you'll see that the path sticks out to the right and left.  Shoot the floor 
tiles of these right and left mini-paths to uncover a hidden triple shot and 
an SS.  You'll then see a chopper that you can take.  A red soldier will 
appear here too.  He drops a B behind.  The chopper will make surviving this 
next part a lot easier.

What you will now be doing is flying over water.  However, there are land 
mines, kamikaze soldiers, self destruct soldiers, and choppers to pass.  Land 
mines are easy to avoid.  This makes self destruct soldiers your primary 
threat.  Rather than telling you which one is which, just keep away from all 
the underwater soldiers.  If you want to know the order, soldiers 1, 3, 4, 5, 
7, and 10 are the self destruct soldiers.  Keep in mind that this ordering is 
based on the order that they appear with soldier 1 being the first underwater 
soldier that you come across.  Keep firing as you fly up.  Stay on the left 
side for the safest path through.  You'll see a red soldier as you fly up.  
He drops an F.  You'll soon see a grenade in the center.  A fake red soldier 
comes out but ignore him.  There should be an island left of the grenades.  
Fire at the floor tiles on the island to uncover a hidden SS.  Continue on 
and a chopper appears to the right.  Ignore it and keep moving.  You'll see 
an island with one spot of water in the center.  Fire at that spot of water 
to uncover a hidden heart.  An enemy chopper will appear above the heart.  A 
green soldier runs out on the right side.  Don't waste your fuel by going 
after him.  Just keep moving ahead.

You'll soon come across three equally shaped island across from one another.  
South of this trio is another island.  Shoot the center of this southern 
island to find a hidden knife.  Then shoot the middle island of the trio to 
uncover some hidden gold bars.  Your chopper should be out of fuel by now so 
get out.  Take care of any self destruct and kamikaze soldiers in the area.  
To the north will be two fortress guards.  Take them both down.  You will be 
in front of three skull doors.  Destroy them all to find bullets and 
grenades.  Behind the doors is a yellow tank.  Destroy the tank next.  Now go 
through the right door only.  The other two doors both have land mines placed 
under the doorway (the part where you can't see your character anymore).  You 
can avoid them by staying to one side on the doorway but it's a lot easier 
just to avoid them altogether.  You will see two fortress guards and two red 
soldiers.  Run up until you are against the wall.  The red soldiers will 
retreat but let them.  You will see them get stuck against the wall to the 
north.  Just worry about killing the fortress guards first.  Now go up and 
kill both red soldiers for an F and L respectively.  You'll then see a green 
tank on the wall above and two skull doors.  Destroying the tank leaves 
behind a tank that you can enter.  Too bad it's out of your reach.  The tank 
just teases you by sitting outside your reach so just blow it up for more 
points.  Then destroy the right skull door because the left door is a fake.  
You'll find bullets and grenades.  Go on through the door.


Gate 4
======
Go on through the door to find a bunker.  Destroy it for bullets and 
grenades.  Past the bunker is a moving cannon.  Let it move to the right side 
before you destroy it.  There is a tank past the cannon that you can use.  
Head up and the red soldier that appears drops a B.  You should have noticed 
that the catwalk to the right forms a square shape.  Shoot the floor in the 
square's center to find a hidden SS.  Then go up to find a bunker.  Destroy 
it for bullets and grenades.  You'll then see a blue soldier with a shield in 
front of him.  This is the task force soldier.  Just think of him as a new 
version of the macho man.  He takes 10 F bullets, 2 grenades, or one B-
grenade to kill.  He also explodes with a B-grenade's explosion radius.  Head 
up and watch out for kamikaze soldiers.  There will also be a moving cannon 
about.  Destroy the soldiers and the cannon.  Head up and you'll see more 
catwalk and more task force soldiers.  There are several here so do not move 
the screen up until you pass each one.  Continue up and you'll see more 
stairs and lots of soldiers.  Ignore the red soldiers because they are fakes.  
Worry about the mob of blue soldiers though.

You will come across two pools and a larger set of stairs above the pools.  
Stand in the center of the two pools and shoot the north side of the northern 
stairs to find a hidden heart.  Continue forward and you'll see two fortress 
guards.  Kill them both.  Now you have two paths to take.  Take the left path 
because the right path has two land mines to avoid.  There is a homing sensor 
placed at the end of the left path but you can avoid it by staying on the far 
left side of the screen as you head up.  You'll now be at another gate.  
Killing the pair of fortress guards will be harder than usual.  The left one 
dies easily but the right one is a pain.  The reason is that the cone to the 
right blocks you from tossing a grenade at the soldier.  Your options can be 
standing next to the cone and tossing B-grenades, using long range shots, or 
trying a risky hit and run tactic with grenades.  Destroy the skull door for 
fuel after you take out the guards.  Now fire up through the door as you go 
through it.  You'll uncover a hidden triple shot.  Get it only if you don't 
have any other gun powerups.


Gate 5
======
You'll now see lots of stairs.  Head up and try to avoid the soldiers' shots 
as best you can.  Kill the red soldier for an F.  Keep moving and you'll see 
some fake red soldiers.  The real red soldier is the one on the right.  He 
drops an L behind.  Follow the paths with floor tiles.  You'll soon see one 
path through a large area of steps and two mini-paths that stick out to the 
left and right sides.  Shoot the floor tiles between the two mini-paths to 
find a hidden H.  Head up to the next pool and you'll see more red soldiers.  
Two of them are real and they both drop B's behind.  Head up and you'll be 
back to oil drum country again.  This time, you will need to pass a lot more 
oil drums.  Keep to the same strategy like before which was to grenade every 
oil drum.  If you see too many oil drums clumped together, then chances are 
that some of them are oil drum soldiers.  Don't be afraid to use your ammo up 
because the oil drum soldiers drop plenty of fuel.  There should be more than 
enough for you to use against the oil drums.

At the end of the oil drums will be a yellow tank.  Destroy it.  You may get 
lucky and get a tank but it's random.  Now head up and two more yellow tanks 
attack you.  Take them both down.  Then go forward and you'll see a homing 
missile soldier on the island by the right side.  Kill him and then head up 
along the left side of the screen.  Watch out for a kamikaze soldier in the 
area.  Head up and you'll see two self destruct soldiers approaching you from 
the left and right sides.  Kill them both quickly or you're toast.  Now 
another self destruct soldier approaches from the right.  You will have a 
little more time to kill him than you did for the last two.  Get the bullets 
in the water.  There is an island in the center of the water.  Get on the 
left side of it.  There is no hidden item in the center of the green pipes 
this time.  Head up and watch out for the kamikaze soldier that comes at you 
from the left.  Then fire up at the floor tiles at the northern tip of the 
island.  You will find Little Athena (girl).  Two self destruct soldiers will 
approach from the right side.  Run back to get them both stuck against the 
green piping.  Then take them out while they're both stuck.

Head up and you'll see a red soldier.  He drops a B.  Now stay to the right 
side.  There are a lot of self destruct soldiers in the area.  They will come 
at you from the left and center.  You should see a narrow strip of water 
above the island on the right with green piping  Stand in this narrow strip 
of water and turn right.  Fire at the water to find a hidden gold heart.  Now 
you have all the firepower that you need so don't lose it.  Head up and a 
kamikaze soldier will chase you from the left.  He shouldn't stand a chance 
against you since you grabbed the gold heart.  You'll see three islands to 
the north.  The left and right islands each have homing missile soldiers on 
them.  The center island has a regular missile soldier.  Take out the homing 
missile soldier on the right.  Then pass the other two so that they become 
grenade soldiers.  Kill them off before you proceed further.

There will be more green pipes separating the path forward.  A red soldier 
comes out.  He drops a B.  If you kill the red soldier, don't immediately get 
the B because there is a fortress guard in a perfect position to kill you as 
you get the B.  Kill him first before getting the B.  There are two more 
fortress guards to deal with in this area.  Anyway, go up the left path.  
Stay to the left as much as possible to avoid the fortress guards.  Of 
course, you are always free to kill them but it isn't necessary to do so 
here.  You'll soon come to two skull doors.  There will be four fortress 
guards on the wall above you.  Try to avoid dying here because you will get 
stuck behind the green piping and will have to wait for the missiles to get 
free.  Kill the left guard first.  Then I hope you have long range shots 
because killing the center two guards is difficult without them.  Now ignore 
the right fortress guard and head up through the left doorway.


Gate 6
======
You'll see two green tanks above you.  You'll be safe as long as you stand 
directly left of the oil drum.  Watch out for a homing sensor placed to the 
left of the oil drum.  You'll be fine as long as you stay near the oil drum.  
Kill the left tank first.  Then destroy the door and the other tank.  Get the 
fuel that the door left behind.  Stop when you see the two fortress guards.  
Killing them both is almost impossible without the necessary firepower so I 
hope you have either F and L powerups or the B-grenades.  Head through the 
doorway and you'll see a land bridge running down the center.  You've entered 
the final area of this mission.  There will be plenty of soldiers in the 
area.  The ones coming out of the water are all self destruct soldiers so 
take them out first.  Then shoot the right column of floor tiles on the land 
bridge to find a hidden heart.  A red soldier runs down the left side of the 
land bridge.  He drops a B.  You will now see red carpeting down the center 
of the screen.  Fortress guards will be on both sides of the carpet.  Take 
them out one by one.  Kamikaze soldiers will be charging down the red carpet 
so give them some star treatment with your guns.  Now you'll come to a skull 
door.  This is the easiest part of this final area so enjoy killing the 
fortress guards without problem.  The door will leave nothing behind.

I hope you have either F and L or just super speed because you will not 
survive this next part without one of these two.  As you head up through the 
doorway, FL soldiers will rush out from both sides and take up positions by 
the yellow piping near the red carpet.  Needless to say, there will be MANY 
shots flying all over the place.  If you have super speed, then simply run up 
down the middle and you will avoid all of the shots.  You must be in the dead 
center of the red carpet or you will get hit.  If you have F and L, then 
quickly run up and pick side to kill.  Then run diagonally towards that side 
and fire away.  You should be able to pick off each FL soldier before he can 
get a shot off.  Move to the side that you picked to avoid getting killed by 
the FL soldiers that you didn't kill.  It is very hard to avoid death but it 
is possible.

After you pass the FL soldiers you will come to a desk with a corpse.  There 
are four FL soldiers and two homing missile soldiers around the desk.  
Between the six of them, almost every square inch of the screen is covered.  
The only safe spot is directly in the center of the red carpet at the bottom 
of the screen.  However, you must be under the gray floor tiles or you will 
get hit.  As you can imagine, this spot is only accessible if you don't move 
the screen up too fast.  The easiest way to get to it is to have run past the 
FL soldiers earlier with super speed.  Then you just keep running up until 
the last FL soldier goes off the screen.  Then immediately turn around and 
head south.  Doing this will let you escape the homing missiles that get 
fired as you headed north.  Now that you are safe, you are also pinned down.  
Getting past this part alive is extremely difficult and everything must be 
done perfectly to live.  Read the section below on how to do it.  This is for 
experts only so unless you are very skilled at the game, I suggest that you 
skip it and take the easier method below that.

***  EXPERTS ONLY!  How to pass without dying.  EXPERTS ONLY!  ***
Here's how to do it.  You must have super speed (SS), B, F, and L.  Having S 
is helpful but not required.  You will run past the FL soldiers and then head 
up the center of the carpet for the desk.  This next part is the critical 
one.  You will be running up and turning northwest to fire shots at the left 
homing missile soldier and leftmost FL soldier.  However, you will need to 
throw a B-grenade diagonally at the right homing missile soldier a moment 
before you do this.  Timing is critical here because one wrong move and the 
left homing missile soldier will fire at you.  After you toss your grenade, 
immediately turn northwest and kill the left homing missile soldier and FL 
soldier by firing at a sharp angle (the sharper of the diagonal lines of fire 
that you have).  Then you will take a step or two downward to avoid the three 
remaining FL soldiers' shots.  Refer to figure 1 below on where to stand.

Figure 1.

As you can see, the spot is exactly the third and fourth gray floor tiles 
south of the left side of the desk.  Figure 2 below shows how the remaining 
FL soldiers will be firing after you reach that spot.

Now that only three FL soldiers remain, it is just a matter of waiting for an 
opportunity to attack.  Take out the two on the right side first because it 
is easier to dodge only one FL soldier's shots than it is for two FL 
soldiers.  Then kill the left one and you've done the near impossible...live 
through the final area end of mission 3.  Now skip over the next paragraph 
below to find out how to finish the mission.
***  end of section  ***

There's no real way to get out of that safe spot without getting shot so I 
suggest that you plan a kamikaze mission.  Your goal is to run up and take 
out as many soldiers as you can but the priority will be the two homing 
missile soldiers.  Run up and try to take them both out.  Doing so will be a 
major plus.  Now you just have to take out the FL soldiers one at a time.  
Expect to die a few more times while doing this.  Take advantage of your 
temporary invulnerability after each death to take out one or more FL 
soldiers.  There is a hidden heart just below the second FL soldier from the 
right.  This part is almost impossible to pass without dying so don't be 
discouraged if you die plenty of times here.  The missiles will not come 
unless you scroll the screen far enough but you'll also lose your safe spot 
if you do.  One word of caution though.  If you scroll the screen up until it 
goes no further (you can see a skull and crossbones behind the desk), then 
you can no longer use the continue code (see section "Secrets" below for 
details) if you lose your last life.  Therefore, it is to your advantage to 
not scroll the screen all the way up.

After you take out all the soldiers, it will seem like there is nowhere to 
go.  First grenade the corpse until it blows up.  Now you should see shadows 
on the south side of the desk.  Move up or down until you are lined up 
horizontally with the shadows.  Now you need to throw a grenade at the floor.  
If you hit the right spot, a stairway will appear.  The spot is random each 
game but the spot is always found somewhere between the floor tiles going 
across the south side of the desk but between the two yellow pipes.  Usually, 
you can find it in the shadows of the desk but occasionally you'll need to 
grenade the gray floor tiles to the left and to the right of the shadows.  I 
have yet to see it get past the yellow piping so I'm relatively sure that you 
won't find them there.  Therefore, it is just a matter of systematically 
tossing grenades at each square (10 squares total) between the two yellow 
pipes until you find the stairs.  Note that you cannot find the stairs unless 
the corpse is gone.  Enter the stairway to finish area 3 and get 30,000 bonus 
points.  You should have nearly 400,000 points if you haven't continued since 
the start of the game.



                       ##############################
                       ##          Area 4          ##
                       ##############################

Start
=====
You'll begin area 4 without any powerups unless you grabbed a heart from area 
3.  If you didn't have a heart when you finished area 3, then say goodbye to 
your powerups.  If you did grab a heart, you will keep everything but you'll 
lose everything if you die once.  Therefore, proceed carefully until you find 
another heart.  If you had nothing when you finished the last mission, then 
the loss isn't so bad but still be on guard as you proceed.

You should immediately have noticed that the background colors are different.  
You are now in the inner fortress so you'll be fighting in darker colored 
backgrounds.  Stay to the left side and go up to find a yellow tank.  A red 
soldier appears from the right side.  He drops a B.  To the north is another 
yellow tank.  It will move diagonally along the red floor.  Destroy it and 
you will see another yellow tank to the right.  Destroy this one too.  Now 
you should that the floor forms a black triangle just below where the tank 
was.  Stand on the right side of the black triangle so that you are next to 
the red floor on the right.  Then face north and fire upward to find a hidden 
SS.  Head up and you'll see two fortress guards on either side.  In the 
center is a red soldier.  He drops a B.  Between the two fortress guards is a 
moving cannon.  Take out the fortress guards first.  Then destroy the cannon.  
You'll see two more red soldiers as you head up the middle.  They both drop 
F's behind.

Now you will see a land bridge running up the middle.  Watch out for a land 
mine at the foot of the land bridge.  There is a kamikaze soldier on either 
side so take them out before you go up the bridge.  You'll soon come across 
an intersection.  Shoot the floor to the left of the intersection to find a 
hidden triple shot.  Continue across the bridge.  There will be a self 
destruct soldier on either side of the bridge so lure them out to kill them.  
There is a homing missile at the end of the bridge so you might want to walk 
in the water to avoid it.  Two red soldiers will come down from the middle 
after the bridge.  They both have L's.  Above you on the left is a fortress 
guard.  Next to him is a moving cannon.  Try to nail them both with a B-
grenade if you have one.  If not, then take the fortress guard out first.  
Now head up the middle.

You'll now see lots of tanks.  Most of them are inactive.  There will be 
yellow tank attacking from the left.  It should be pretty obvious which one 
it is.  Destroy it and then head up.  Watch out for a land mine near the 
center.  You'll be attacked by two yellow tanks.  One comes down the middle 
while the other is on the right side.  Destroy the middle one first.  Then 
take out the other one.  A red soldier should have followed behind the middle 
tank.  If you don't see him then you probably killed him when you destroyed 
the middle tank.  It is no big loss because he only had an S.  You will find 
a tank to take on the left side.  Do not enter it yet.  To the north are two 
homing missile soldiers.  You will want to kill the left one before entering 
the tank or he will destroy it.  You can just pass the other soldier and kill 
him once he becomes a grenade soldier.  You'll now find yourself at the foot 
of the first gate.  There are the same old fortress guards around the skull 
door.  Take them out and then destroy the door.  Get the fuel and bullets 
left behind and head on through.


Gate 1
======
Fire at the yellow pipes directly north of the gateway to find a hidden SS.  
You will be attacked by a yellow tank to the left.  Destroy it.  Then go up 
but watch out for a land mine.  To the right is another yellow tank.  Destroy 
it and head up.  You'll see a red soldier.  Kill him for a B.  Now in the 
center is a fortress guard and a moving cannon.  Take your time and wait for 
the cannon to come back to destroy it.  Kill the fortress guard in the 
meantime.  Do not chase after the cannon because you will die easily.  Now 
you have two paths to take.  Take the right path because the left has three 
homing sensors placed very close to each other.  Head up the right path and 
you'll see a red soldier.  He drops an F but don't worry about him.  On the 
wall above you are two soldiers.  The left is an FL soldier and the right is 
a fortress guard.  The FL soldier is your top priority.  Take him down before 
you do anything else.  Then kill the fortress guard.

Head up and you'll see four purple tunnels separated by pink piping.  Each 
tunnel has two sections.  Take whichever tunnel you want but here is what is 
in each tunnel.  I'll call the tunnels, 1-4 starting from the left.  So the 
far left tunnel is tunnel 1 while the far right one is tunnel 4.  Each tunnel 
has a hidden item that you can find by simply firing as you go through the 
tunnel.  Tunnel 1 has a hidden knife and grenades in the first half.  Tunnel 
2 has a hidden heart near the end of the second half but there is a homing 
sensor near the heart.  Tunnel 3 has a triple shot in the first half.  Tunnel 
4 has a gold box in the second half.  There are also two homing sensors at 
the end of the tunnel.  Based on these descriptions, I would take the first 
half of tunnel 1 for the knife and then switch over to tunnel 2 to get the 
heart as well.  If you just want to blaze through without anything, then just 
take tunnel 3.  Kamikaze soldiers will be chasing you in the tunnels but they 
won't be a threat since you should be in a tank.

You'll see a fortress guard in the center after you pass through the tunnels.  
To his left is a red soldier.  He drops an L.  Kill them both and head up via 
the right side.  You'll see an FL soldier on the wall above.  Kill him.  Then 
head up going down the center.  You'll encounter two red soldiers.  Both of 
them carry S's each.  Watch out for the self destruct soldier to the right of 
the second red soldier.  I suggest retreating behind the FL soldier's wall to 
get him stuck.  You'll then see a homing missile soldier in the center.  Take 
him out carefully.  You'll then be at the foot of a gate.  There are three 
skull doors but no fortress guards.  Destroy the doors.  The left door drops 
fuel, the middle door drops grenades, and the right door drops bullets.  The 
left and right doors both have land mines under the doorway so avoid them by 
staying to the left or right side of the doorway as you pass under.  I prefer 
to get the fuel to restock my ammo and then just taking the middle door since 
there is no mines there (no one said you had to go through the door 
completely).  You'll now see two fortress guards.  Kill them both.  Then 
you'll see two more skull doors.  Above the doors is a fortress guard.  Kill 
the guard.  Then destroy the right door because the left is a fake.  Get the 
fuel and head on through.


Gate 2
======
You will see water above you.  Do not enter it yet.  Look at the floor 
between the gate and the water.  The top half should be purple floor tiles 
while the bottom half is all black.  Go left along the black floor and fire 
at the floor on the far left side to find a hidden gold heart.  Now you have 
the firepower necessary to cross the water.  Now head up into the water.  
Stay on the right side.  You'll soon see a kamikaze soldier above you.  Kill 
him and move on.  You then see two red soldiers.  The left is real and 
carries an F while the right one is a fake.  Head forward and you'll see 
three things.  The first is a red soldier from the right side.  He carries a 
B.  The second is the fortress guard on the island to your north.  The third 
is the self destruct soldier heading towards you from the left.  Kill the red 
soldier first because he's closer to you.  Then take aim and kill the self 
destruct soldier.  This should be no problem thanks to the gold heart you 
grabbed earlier.  Kill the fortress guard last.

Continue onward and you'll soon see another kamikaze soldier.  The next 
submerged soldier after him is a self destruct soldier.  You'll then see a 
fortress guard on a small island in the center.  Kill him and head up.  A 
green soldier runs out from the left while a self destruct soldier will 
approach from the right.  Kill the green soldier for the K and use it to kill 
the self destruct soldier.  Head up and you may see another self destruct 
soldier depending if you got him with the K.  Kill him if you do see him.  
You'll now find yourself in oil drum country again.  Just grenade every oil 
drum and you'll kill them all.  Go wild with the grenades because the fuel 
that the soldiers drop is more than enough for you to lay waste to the area.  
Just remember, if there are too many oil drums grouped together, then you can 
expect one or more of them is an oil drum soldier.  You'll encounter a red 
soldier at the end of the oil drums.  He drops an F behind.

Now to your left on the wall is a moving cannon.  A red soldier will come 
down the left path.  He carries a B.  You have two paths to take.  Go with 
the right path.  Stay against the right wall as you head up to avoid the land 
mine.  At the end of both paths are flame thrower soldiers.  Just stay out of 
their line of fire and you'll be ok.  Now above you should be an red octagon 
shaped pattern in the floor.  Shoot the center of it to find a hidden heart.  
Now to the left is a moving cannon.  It is hard to hit because it is moving 
diagonally.  You'll need to get close to it to nail it with your grenades.  
Then head up and you'll see a chopper to the left that you can take.  Two 
moving cannons will be on the right side.  You'll need to destroy them both 
before getting into the chopper.  The red soldier in the area drops an L.  

Get in the chopper now.  You have 28 seconds of fuel left so there isn't much 
time.  You will fly along the left side and make a beeline straight up.  Do 
not stop for anything.  The only thing you need to watch out for are self 
destruct soldiers and land mines.  Do not blow up enemy choppers or you'll 
get caught in the explosion.  You'll encounter some red soldiers as you fly 
across.  They drop F, B, S, and S in that order.  You can find a hidden 
triple shot by firing at the yellow piping to the right of the first purple 
triangle wall above the chopper.  Now just fly north but make sure that you 
are all the way to the left.  You'll soon see an island in the center with 
pink and yellow piping.  There will be underwater soldiers below you but 
don't worry because they are merely kamikaze soldiers.  Now there should be a 
narrow strip of land running up the left side.  It should be under you if you 
are flying on the far left side.  Just keep firing north as you fly over this 
strip of land and you'll uncover a hidden SS about halfway up.

Now keep flying north.  A chopper passes down the center.  Ignore it.  Then 
you'll see an island to the north that has mainly yellow piping on it.  Fire 
at the center of the south side to uncover a hidden gold box.  Then continue 
flying north.  You should see some small islands and another chopper.  A self 
destruct soldier on the left side will be unable to kill you if you keep 
flying up along the far left side.  You should run out of fuel right as you 
pass the three small islands.  Head up the steps to the north to find 
yourself in front of the third gate.  Go around the pink piping by way of the 
left side.  Destroy both doors and you'll see the usual bullets and grenades.  
Do not enter the left door.  That passageway is rigged with land mines.  You 
can always just walk around them by hugging the sides of the passageway.  I 
find it's easier to just take the right door and not have to avoid any mines 
at all.


Gate 3
======
Head up and you'll see plenty of tanks.  A yellow tank appears from the 
middle.  Destroy it.  Then you'll see a yellow tank move across from the left 
side.  Destroy it and then head left until you are standing between the two 
left columns of tanks.  You should have triggered a land mine.  Shoot the 
floor above the mine to find a hidden heart.  Now go north and stay between 
the left tanks.  Now you'll see another yellow tank to your north and two 
more yellow tanks on the right hand side.  A red soldier will also be there.  
He drops a B.  Destroy only the left yellow tank.  Then head up until the 
bottom tank on the right goes off the screen.  Now you only have one tank to 
deal with.  Be careful when going near the center because there are land 
mines and homing sensors placed in the center.

You will see another red soldier approach from the center.  He has a B.  Now 
there will be more purple tunnels to pick from.  There are five altogether.  
I will label them 1-5 again starting from the left.  Tunnel 1 has a missile 
soldier inside.  Tunnel 2 has nothing.  Tunnel 3 has a land mine at the end.  
Tunnel 4 has nothing.  Tunnel 5 has a hidden knife.  Just fire up into it to 
find it.  Based on this evaluation, tunnel 5 is the preferred tunnel if you 
don't have a knife.  Otherwise go for tunnel 4.  Now you'll see an area split 
into three paths by pink pipes.  The left path has a homing sensor at the 
opening in the pink pipes to the left so don't take it.  Go for the middle 
path instead.  If you are in a tank, then you are probably running low on 
fuel.  Quickly navigate your way to the northernmost cone.  Shoot the yellow 
pipes directly south of this cone to find a hidden H.  This will add 200 
seconds of fuel which is far more than you need.

Head up and you'll see a yellow tank.  Don't bother hiding behind the cones 
because it is equipped with missiles.  Destroy the tank and head up by way of 
the left side.  There is a homing sensor near the center so keep an eye out 
for it.  You will now see four land bridges leading up.  Yellow tanks will be 
patrolling every bridge except the far left one.  Take the left bridge.  This 
means that you only need to destroy the left tank.  Then you can cross 
without fear of getting shot.  You will see some water after you cross the 
bridges.  There will be two red soldiers on the screen.  Kill them both for 
L's.  Now I hope you haven't moved the screen too much.  You should still be 
able to see the end of the four bridges.  Now look at the water between the 
two bridges closest to the left.  Line yourself up so that you are north of 
this water.  Then head up and fire at the second stream of water (the one 
with the land mine) to find a hidden SS in the water.  If that sounds 
confusing, then just stand on the land between the two water streams and then 
stand on the fourth block from the left side.  Fire north and you'll find it.

Now you'll see a yellow tank moving across the land bridge.  Destroy the tank 
from the southern land bridge or you'll get hit by the mines in the water.  
Cross after you've taken care of the tank.  Head up and you'll see stairs 
that cover nearly the entire screen.  You don't have time to admire the 
scenery though because a self destruct soldier will be coming at you from the 
left side.  He is the one that runs down the left side of the steps near the 
mine.  You might want to move left or right because he has difficulty 
climbing stairs.  As an aside, if you get the self destruct soldier to 
explode near the land mine, it will also be destroyed.  Anyway, head up along 
the left side of the stairs and you'll see a second self destruct soldier 
coming towards you from the right side.  Kill him and then get in the water.  
Face north and fire at the steps.  You'll find a hidden heart.

Now head up and you'll see more stairs and two tanks on a narrow path cutting 
through the stairs.  Do not enter the bottom tank because there is a land 
mine placed directly under that tank.  Take the top tank instead.  There are 
two things to do before you enter the top tank.  First, get on top of it 
first.  Then turn right.  Fire at the steps directly to the right of the tank 
to uncover a hidden triple shot.  Now the second thing you need to do is to 
slowly move up until you can see the two homing missile soldiers to the 
north.  Do not move too far up or you'll lose the tank or get attacked by the 
homing missile soldiers.  Now here's how to take them out.  You probably have 
noticed that you automatically start sliding whenever you are on any stairs.  
Well, you are going use this knowledge to your advantage.  Make sure that you 
are out of the homing missile soldiers' attack range.  Now you will get on 
the stairs, face north and start sliding.  Then fire and kill the soldiers as 
they come into your line of fire.  Note that this tactic only works if you 
have long range shots.  Otherwise you may have to sacrifice your tank to get 
past them.

Now you will see a land bridge zigzagging to the northeast.  The red soldier 
in the water drops an F.  The submerged soldier is just a kamikaze soldier 
which is nothing against your tank.  Head up and you'll see another submerged 
soldier north of the land bridge.  This one is a self destruct soldier so 
take him out while he's still in the water.  You'll now see a red soldier 
coming from the center.  He has a B.  Don't go after the red soldier because 
there are land mines on the bridge.  It is very easy to lose your focus and 
land on the mine if you're too busy going after the red soldier.  It should 
not be a surprise that the red soldier appears directly north of a mine.  Now 
you'll see a bunker at the end of the land bridge.  Watch out for the mine 
south of the bunker.  Destroy the bunker for bullets and grenades.  Now you 
have two paths heading north.  Take the left one and fire at the floor tiles 
as you head up.  You'll uncover a knife on the tiles left of the top right 
pool.

Now you'll be fighting black soldiers.  Don't worry because they die as 
easily as regular soldiers.  You'll then be in front of four tunnels.  I'll 
call them tunnels 1-4 starting from the left again.  Tunnels 1 and 4 are 
safe.  Tunnels 2 and 3 both have land mines in them and there is no way to 
walk around them.  Taking tunnels 1 or 4 would be the smart thing to do 
right?  Well, tunnel 3 has a hidden triple shot in it.  It's not particularly 
useful unless you don't have other gun powerups.  However, if you do choose 
to get it, then you need to stop right after you get it because there is a 
land mine directly above the spot it appears.  Now take either tunnel 1 or 
tunnel 4 up to the gate.  You'll then realize why tunnels 2 and 3 both had 
mines.  The reason was to make killing the two fortress guards by the gate 
more difficult.  This isn't a problem for those with long range or B-
grenades.  However, killing them without powerups requires good timing and a 
little luck.  Take them both out and then destroy the skull door.  Then get 
the fuel and head through the gate.


Gate 4
======
You'll be greeted immediately by a fortress guard on the wall above you.  
Clear the area of soldiers first.  The red soldier drops an S.  Grenade the 
guard after you have cleared enough soldiers.  Now head up along the right 
side.  Stay close to the right side the entire time.  You'll come across 
another red soldier.  He also drops an S.  Now you'll see a very tight 
opening between the purple walls on the right.  You should be able to see the 
mine.  What you need to do is to carefully move into the small space between 
the left of the mine and the purple wall.  It is tricky but possible to 
squeeze through.  As you head up you will see an FL soldier on the wall to 
the north.  Squeezing through the small space gives you a perfect vantage 
point from which to kill the soldier.  The red soldiers that you see on the 
screen both have L's.

Carefully head down the center but keep an eye out for land mines.  Now stay 
to the left side.  You'll see fortress guards on the walls on both sides.  
Two flame thrower soldiers are between them.  Kill the fortress guards first.  
Then pick off the flame thrower soldiers.  You'll need to do all this on 
foot.  This also applies to those with tanks because the tank will not be 
able to past the stairs so there's no point in staying in the tank any 
longer.  There is a hidden heart under the left flame thrower soldier.  You 
should have found it as you were killing the soldier.  After you wipe out 
everyone, just head north.  Stay on the steps.  They may slow you down but 
not as much as walking in water does.  Watch out for kamikaze soldiers as you 
charge ahead.

You'll soon come to two tunnels.  A fortress guard is positioned high atop 
the wall between the tunnels.  Take him down first.  Now you have a choice.  
The left tunnel has a hidden H in it while the right tunnel has a hidden SS.  
Both are found by just shooting inside of each tunnel.  Unless you really, 
really need ammo, I advise taking the right tunnel.  If you are careful, you 
can get your cake and eat it too because you can move up to get the H and 
then double back around to the right tunnel and be on your way.  Watch out 
for a self destruct soldier in the tunnels.  Now on the other side of the 
tunnel is the reason why we took it instead of the left one, the FL soldier.  
He is high on the right wall.  If you had taken the left route, then he would 
have had an easier time sniping you.  In the center is a fortress guard.  
Left of him is a homing missile soldier.  Kill the fortress guard.  Don't 
waste your time with the homing missile soldier.  Just head up the right 
path.

You'll now be at the foot of a gate.  Shoot the top of the oil drum to find a 
hidden heart.  Now you have the same old fortress guards to take care of.  
Kill the left one first because he's easier to kill.  Now the cone on the 
right will make killing the right guard a pain.  Try to find a good angle and 
let him have a taste of your grenades.  Destroy the skull door afterwards.  
Grab the fuel and bullets that the door leaves behind.  Now move up slowly 
until you see the next pair of fortress guards.  Killing these two will be 
tough without F or L powerups.  If you have them both, then just run back to 
the front of the gate, line up under them, and fire away.  If you don't have 
these powerups then you'll need to quickly run up, turn and toss a grenade, 
and then run back.  Hopefully, you will dodge the guards' B-grenades.  Now 
head through the rest of the gate.


Gate 5
======
You'll immediately see a red soldier.  He carries an F.  Then you should spot 
a homing missile soldier on an island to the northwest.  Head down the center 
of the screen and you'll see a self destruct soldier rush out from the 
center.  You are in the perfect position to kill him so waste him before he 
wastes you.  Head up and you'll now see a missile soldier to the right.  A 
red soldier appears in the center.  He carries a B.  Now head up and you'll 
see a stationary yellow tank on the left island.  Although the pink pipes to 
the left prevent an easy grenade toss, it won't matter since you picked up B-
grenades.  A red soldier will come at you from the right side.  He also drops 
a B.  Head up the center and a self destruct soldier comes down.  Kill him 
quickly.

Now you should see that pink pipes split the path forward in two.  Do not go 
up the right side.  It leads to a dead end.  However, if you stand on the far 
right side and shoot north towards the water at the top, then you will find a 
hidden heart.  Unfortunately, after you get this heart, the screen will be 
too far up and you will be forced to die.  This renders getting the heart 
completely useless and detrimental if you already had a heart because now you 
will lose everything if you die again.  Save yourself the headache and take 
the left side instead.  Now you should have already spotted the two yellow 
tanks waiting for you ahead.  Destroy the left one by attacking from atop the 
yellow pipes.  Then run up along the left side.  Turn right and destroy the 
other tank.  Do not engage the other tank while you are in the water or you 
will surely die.

Head north until you see another yellow tank to the left.  It will be on top 
of pink pipes.  Grenade it and then look at the island east of the one that 
the tank was one.  It will have four purple floor tiles on it.  Shoot the 
northern purple floor tile to find a hidden SS.  Head up the middle and 
you'll see another yellow tank on the left island.  Stand to the right of the 
leftmost pink piping and face north.  You'll be safe from the tank's missiles 
at that location.  Then grenade the tank.  Now you have two paths to take.  
Do not go right or you'll get stuck in a dead end and this time there is no 
hidden heart there to save you.  Continue to head down the center.  You'll 
quickly spot a self destruct soldier swimming towards.  Take him down and 
continue onward.

You'll see four land bridges leading up.  Two yellow tanks patrol the two 
middle bridges.  You can destroy them both with one B-grenade by tossing it 
in the center pool of water.  The explosion radius is wide enough to take 
them both out.  Now head up through the middle pool of water.  A red soldier 
comes at you from the right pool of water.  He leaves an L behind.  A self 
destruct soldier will run at you from the left pool of water.  Killing him 
will be easy since he has trouble scaling the steps.  Don't get careless and 
get shot by him.  Now you will come across four tunnels.  I'll label them 1-4 
starting from the left.  Tunnels 1 and 3 both have homing sensors in them so 
take tunnel 4 instead.  Tunnel 2 is also safe but tunnel 4 is faster.  Now 
you'll see three skull doors but no fortress guards.  Take out the doors.  
The right door is the only one that drops nothing behind.  The other two both 
have land mines in them so take the right door to avoid the mines.  You've 
now passed through gate 6.


Gate 6
======
You'll be immediately attacked by two moving cannons.  The right cannon will 
be your immediate threat if you took the right door through the gate.  
Destroy whichever cannon is closest to you.  Then take out the other.  Now 
head up along the left side.  You'll see two more moving cannons on the right 
side.  You should see a red octagon pattern on the left side.  Stand under 
it.  Now wait for an opportunity to attack the left cannon.  Then you should 
have noticed that the other cannon is nowhere to be found.  It actually went 
up off the screen and will return in a little while.  Move over to the right 
and wait for it to come back.  You can move the screen forward to help speed 
things up.  Destroy the cannon after it reappears.  Then stand to the right 
of the red octagon pattern and head up to fight a super tank.  It's been 
awhile since you last fought one of these so take it out with some grenades.  
Now head up.

You'll see five tunnels.  I'll label them 1-5 starting from the left again.  
Do not take any of them.  Every one except the middle one is rigged with a 
land mine that is unavoidable.  Instead, stand in front of tunnel 4.  Then 
shoot up through it.  You'll uncover a hidden heart.  Then head up.  You will 
see a new enemy, the armored soldier.  This guy can be treated like a regular 
soldier except for two differences.  The first difference is that he fires 
lasers.  Although the lasers may look deadly, they will not kill you if you 
have a knife.  The second difference is that the soldiers will explode 
(regular grenade sized explosion) if you kill them.  This means that you 
cannot use the knife powerup to kill them through contact.  Getting the 
immunity from lasers more than justifies losing the ability to kill the 
soldiers through contact.  Just keep away from them and you'll be fine.

Now you should run up through the opening between tunnel 2 and the cone.  
Then you will see two moving cannons.  You only have a second to quickly toss 
a B-grenade up after you see them.  The grenade will destroy both cannons if 
you threw it fast enough.  If you weren't fast enough, then you will need to 
move left or right to avoid the missiles that got fired by the cannons.  Head 
up and you'll see red carpeting going down the center.  This should clue you 
in that you are in the final area if you haven't already figured it out from 
fighting the armored soldiers.  Head up the center of the carpet and fire 
away.  You'll find a hidden heart on the near the center of the carpet 
between the second and third row of purple floor tiles on the sides of the 
carpet.  Head up the middle and you'll soon see two more moving cannons.  
Quickly toss a grenade to destroy them.  Now to the right is an armored L 
soldier.  Think of him as an FL soldier.  Take him down.  Then head up and 
you'll see another armored L soldier come out from the left side.  Take him 
down as well.  You'll now be at a gate.  The left soldier above the gate is 
an armored L soldier.  The right one is an armored fortress guard.  Take out 
the L soldier first.  Then kill the fortress guard.  Destroy the door to find 
fuel.  Head on through the gate.


Gate 7
======
Start firing down the middle to find a hidden heart at the bottom of the 
carpet.  Now I hope you still have a knife on you or the armored soldiers 
will be difficult to pass.  Leave nothing to chance and waste everyone as you 
head up.  Stay to the left of the carpet.  You'll soon come to gray flashing 
floor tiles.  To your north are two armored missile soldiers.  These guys 
will chase after you and explode with B-grenade radius if you kill them.  The 
left soldier will be your immediate threat.  Quickly shoot or grenade him 
from a distance.  Do not kill him in close range or the explosion will kill 
you.  The other soldier should have been caught against a wall if you were 
far enough to the left.  Run diagonally to him and finish him off.

Now stand on the far left or far right side of the carpet.  I strongly 
recommend the far right side.  Make sure that you are still on the carpet 
however.  Then head up and you'll face the final boss of the game.  Since he 
looks like a skull, why not call the boss "Skull Face?"  Now his attack is to 
spit out two fireballs that explode like B-grenades.  However, his aim is 
just like every other enemy in the game.  So if you stay to one side of his 
face, you can dodge his shots.  Do not stand left or right of the red carpet 
or Skull Face will shoot diagonally at you.  Standing directly in front of 
Skull Face is obviously a suicide mission.  Before I forget, you can no 
longer use the continue code once you start fighting Skull Face.

Now if you look carefully, you should see six blocks in front of Skull Face 
that look different from the other floor tiles.  These blocks cannot be 
passed through.  This is the reason why you should stay on the right side of 
the carpet.  If you look at it, you will see that you can approach Skull Face 
from the right side without having to waste time going around the blocks.  
However, heading up via the left side of the carpet will force you to go 
around the block in your way.  Doing so will definitely cause Skull Face to 
fire diagonally at you.  It should be apparent that the black and gray 
striped lines running diagonally out from Skull Face are actually walls and 
cannot be passed through.  It is also interesting to note that you can stand 
on Skull Face himself without dying.  Only his shots can kill you.

Anyway, just get within grenade range and toss grenades at Skull Face until 
he blows up.  You need to be close enough or you'll get caught by Skull 
Face's shot explosions.  His face will start to flash red after you inflict 
enough damage.  It takes around 10-15 grenades to destroy him.  He will leave 
a gold heart behind.  Now you have two options.  You can finish the game now 
or continue playing from the beginning with your score intact.  If you want 
to win the game now, then grab the gold heart.  You will get 40,000 bonus 
points.  You should have over 500,000 points if you never continued since the 
start of the game.

If you want to keep playing then recall how you finished area 3.  Recall that 
you found a hidden staircase by tossing a grenade at the right spot.  For 
this part, the right spot is on the row of spaces directly above the red 
carpet and below the six impassable blocks.  Just systematically grenade each 
spot along that row and you'll find a hidden staircase.  The location is 
different every time but it usually is around the center although it 
sometimes can be found farther out.  Enter it to finish area 4.  You'll get 
40,000 bonus points like usual.  Then you won't see the congratulatory 
message.  Instead, you will start at area 1.  Your score will remain intact 
as will your items if you still had a heart when you entered the stairs.


Congratulations on finishing the game no matter what option you choose.  Now 
I present the ending in all its glory.  Trust me it's not that great.  Yes, 
the text is the exact message that is said.
