1)                          The world is veiled in

                           darkness.  The wind stops,

                                the sea is wild,

                          and the earth begins to rot.

                                 The people wait,

                          their only hope, a prophecy....



                         " When the world is in darkness

                            Four Warriors will come...."



                            After a long journey, four

                              young warriors arrive,

                               each holding an ORB.



With these prophetic words, the four Light Warriors will arrive at Coneria,
and you will be the one who controls their actions, movements, and their
destinies...

Welcome to the origin game for one of the most beloved game series ever...
Final Fantasy.  Although this game has been covered well, I feel a need to
write as it brought me so much joy as I was growing up as a way to share
that joy (a tad corny, eh?).  Anyway, I hope you will enjoy my take on the
game as well as the input of many of the internet gaming community (provided
you guys and gals send stuff, which I really appreciate!).

2) This section will look at the controls for the overworld and battle.


                                o-----------o
                                | Overworld |
                                o-----------o

D-Pad   : Moves your party in the direction pressed.

SELECT  : Opens the party order menu.

START   : Opens the regular menu.

B Button: No apparent use.

A Button: Talks to people, examines objects, and open Treasure Chests.


                                 o--------o
                                 | Battle |
                                 o--------o

D-Pad   : Moves your hand cursor in the direction pressed.

SELECT  : No apparent use.

START   : No apparent use.

B Button: Cancels a command and returns to the previous one.

A Button: Confirms a command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------Stats-----------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) This section will look at the various stats that each character has and
   what they mean.


                                 o----------o
                                 | Strength |
                                 o----------o

Marked as: STR.

This stat will help determine your Damage total when attacking, with 
characters gain 1 Damage for every two points of Strength.  However, total 
damage is not completely determined through this stat as Hit% plays a role 
in the multiple hit attacks, so a separate calculation is made for all of 
the hits.


                                 o---------o
                                 | Agility |
                                 o---------o

Marked as: AGL.

This stat has the honour of helping to determine your Evade%, along with the
heaviness of your Armor.  A higher Agility will help your characters to
dodge incoming attacks easier.


                               o--------------o
                               | Intelligence |
                               o--------------o

Marked as: INT.

For this stat, I can discern no real purpose.  it does not seem to have an
effect on the strength of spell power (which appears to be randomized), and
characters cannot make changes mid-battle form your commands (so no rating
an AI with this stat either).  It also does not appear to have any bearing
upon Magical Defense as suggested previously, thanks to some extra info from
the Final Fantasy board at GameFAQs.


                                o----------o
                                | Vitality |
                                o----------o

Marked as: VIT.

This stat helps determine your overall Hit Point totals, with every four 
points of Vitality brings the gain of an additional Hit Point at each level.



                                  o------o
                                  | Luck |
                                  o------o

Marked as: LUCK

This stat seems to have one sole purpose, and that is to guage the ability
of a character to escape battle.  When running, a character's Luck is 
compared to the status byte of the character two positions lower, where as
the two bottom-rank characters are compared to a random value to determine
their running ability.


                                 o--------o
                                 | Damage |
                                 o--------o

Marked as: DAMAGE

This stat is derived from your Strength stat that is cut in half and added
to the damage rating of your equipped weapon.  It is the stat used to
determine the damage dealt to an enemy (combined with the opposition's
Absorb and random factors).


                                  o------o
                                  | Hit% |
                                  o------o

Marked as: Hit%

This stat will determine the accuracy of a character's attack as well as the
quantity of hits they can land in one attack.


                                 o--------o
                                 | Absorb |
                                 o--------o

Marked As: ABSORB

This stat determines how much damage a character takes if an opponent lands
a blow.  The stat is determined by combining the Absorb stat all of the
equipped Armor on a character, BUT the Black Belt/Master has a bug where
their Absorb will be equal to their level (although their equipment will
retain any special defensive bonuses they contained).  If your Absorb is
higher than that of the Damage attack of your attacker, the resulting Hit
Point loss will always be 1 Hit Point, so no 0 damage will ever be taken.


                                 o--------o
                                 | Evade% |
                                 o--------o

Marked As: Evade%

This stat will determine if an enemy hits an attack on your character or
not.  It may also play a role in how many hits an enemy can land on your
character.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------Characters--------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) This section will examine each type of character, listing the advantages,
   disadvantages, and general use of each character.  Please note that each
   sub-section will be for both parts of the character tree (before and
   after changing class), one paragraph summing up each Class that a 
   specific character can be.


                              o----------------o
                              | Fighter/Knight |
                              o----------------o

The Fighter will be your big bad front man for any team you have.  He has
high Strength, Hit Points, and he can also equip nearly every type of Armor
and Weapon you find along the journey.  However, this character does have
the downside of no magic to call upon, but do you really need to cast spells
when you have a very dangerous weapons user anyway?

The Knight is an improved version of the Fighter in a few ways, mainly in
his use of even MORE weapons and armors than before!  Add onto that the
ability to use low level White Magic charges (Levels 1-3), and you have a
nearly unkillable force, protected by great armor, and the ability to do
some self healing.


                             o-------------------o
                             | Black Belt/Master |
                             o-------------------o

The Black Belt starts out as a decent attacker who misses a fair bit when he
attacks, but blossoms into a machine of flying fists once he levels high
enough.  He has no use of magic at all, he can equip very little armor, but
he does gain some fairly good Hit Points (although not as much as the
Fighter unless really high levels are reached).

When upgraded to a Master, a Black Belt gains... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  That
being said, this character will continue to radically improve his abilities
to land multiple hits as well as having many of them being critical hits.
The downside is that certain enemies are tougher to hurt (higher Absorb),
thus the damage dealt is low due to no weapon being used (NEVER use weapons
on these guys though if you want to deal big damage).  It has also been 
brought to my attention that the Master actually develops WORSE Magical 
Defense than the Black Belt (see the Magical Defenses in the Bug/Oddities
section for more details).


                                o-------------o
                                | Thief/Ninja |
                                o-------------o

The Thief is an interesting character to choose because he is an odd
character.  He has decent strength, decent Hit Points, and a moderate Hit%,
but he has such horrendous weapon choices that he deals little damage.  His
main (ie only) skill as a Thief is his ability to run away from battles at a
slightly more successful rate than your character in front of the party
(usually the position of a character determines their running ability).  Not
a very useful class to have.

The Ninja however, is a very NICE reward for putting up with the Thief's
incompetence.  The Ninja gains the abilities of equipping nearly every
weapon and armor you come across as well as learning some low level Black
Magic spell charges (Level 1-4, including the highly useful Fast spell).
With all of this you have a harder hitting, spell casting, speed machine on 
your side.


                            o---------------------o
                            | Red Mage/Red Wizard |
                            o---------------------o

Red Mage is the jack of all trades, with the abilities to equip fairly good
weapons, armors, and both types of Magic.  That being said, his stats are
not outstanding and they slowly start to lag behind other more specialized
characters (but he does not have an inherit weakness either).  He does
suffer from a lack of high end Magic spells, beginning at Level 5.

The Red Wizard is kind of an expansion of the earlier class to include
better weapons and armors, and even some higher magic (like Life and Exit).
However, he can not reach the Level 8 spells no matter how strong he is, but
this is a small price to pay for a well-rounded warrior.


                           o-------------------------o
                           | White Mage/White Wizard |
                           o-------------------------o

The White Mage is a limited weapons and armor user who can not be counted on
in battle to deal damage.  That said, this character shines through in those
tough battles where some extra defense is needed or some dire Curing
emergency.

When the White Wizard rolls around to join the group, you will not gain many
new armor or weapon abilities, but Level 6 and higher spells will become
available to this specialist, including: Cur4, Lif2, Wall, Exit,  and Fade. 
That being said, White Wizards are still a fair liability in battle 
offensively and defensively, but they can be very useful in certain 
situations.


                           o--------------------------o
                           | Black Mage/ Black Wizard |
                           o--------------------------o

The Black Mage is a limited weapons and armor user who cannot be counted on
in battle to deal damage physically.  However, this little pointy hat toting
fellow can buy himself attacks spells to dole out the damage as well as
spells to disable the enemy or enhance his allies abilities.  He gets the
lowest Hit Points of all of the characters.

The Black Wizard changes a lot... in physical looks.  Otherwise, more Black
Magic can be learned (right up to Level 8), including the godly Nuke spell.
The Catclaw is also available for a very dependable weapon, so the attacking
abilities will be increased.  That said, the sole reason to have one of
these guys is to deal out magical damage and strengthen your team's attacks
through stat altering spells.

5) In a section contributed from the reader as well as myself, a listing of
   various combinations of teams that are strong, unique, or a challenge to
   use.  Many thanks to Red Scarlet/Agrias Oaks for input on EVERY TEAM
   listed here, as well as the Final Fantasy Origins Board at
   www.gamefaqs.com for their input and support.


                o------------------------------------------o
                | Fighter/Black Belt/White Mage/Black Mage |
                o------------------------------------------o

Perhaps the most popular party beginners go for... it is a group that is
weak to start with because the Fighter is the only strong attacker.

                             =================
                             At The Start Pros
                             =================

Diversity in the party.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

The Fighter is the only real good attacker, until the Black Mage gets Level
3 spells.  The Black Belt is a pretty weak (defensively) Second character,
but eventually will become a better physical attacker after Level 10 and
slowly get decent defense (through the Absorb Oddity).  Expect the Black 
Belt to die a couple times against strong enemies for a while.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

You don't really need to spend much on the Fighter nor the Black Belt (Steel
Armor is a debatable expenditure for your Fighter).  However, spells, spells,
spells will build up your bills as you arrive at each new locale.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

You have two strong attackers with high HP as well as two spellcasters who
can learn the best spells of each magic type.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

Lots of really good weapons will go to waste, as the Knight will be the only
character who can equip them.  The Black Mage will seem less useful as the
game goes on especially when you start acquiring items/equipment that cast
spells.  Fast will remain useful to use on the Knight and/or Master.  The
White Wizard will not be much more than a backup Item user (an occasional
life saver in a hard hitting battle).


                o--------------------------------------------o
                | Fighter/Fighter/Fighter & Fighter/Red Mage |
                o--------------------------------------------o

Perhaps the most loved grouping, either party offers some incredibly easy
playing.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

High attack power, excellent defense.  Physical damage to the party will be
low.  If you buy Silver Swords for all four Fighters early on, then you can
just hack through just about anything for most, if not all of the game.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

Very little diversity, no magic until class change, and even then you will
have very limited White magic.  Battle items can break the monotony of
constantly using Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight every battle though.  Due to
the heavy armor of the Fighter, their Evade is low.  Prepare to get
frustrated at places with undead monsters that paralyze and look out for
Sorcerers too.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

At the start you will be hurting for cash if you want to buy every upgrade
you come across.  Buying four suits of Steel Armor can take quite a long
time to do (again it is debatable if that is even wise).  About halfway into
the game, you will keep gaining money with nothing to buy whatsoever.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Four walking tanks, although the last character will have sub-par equipment
compared to the other three Knights (not by a whole lot though).  You can
however make it up with proper armor distribution (Aegis Shield + Dragon Armor
is comparable to a Ribbon that the other three Knights might have equipped).
Very powerful attacks from all four characters.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

Little to no magic that is helpful at the end of the game.  Cur2 is too weak
to attempt to heal a near-dead character in battle.  The fourth Knight will
be weaker compared to the other three in both weapons and armor.

Very strong party, kind of boring in what the characters can do (mainly
fight), but fun if you want to just Fight your way through the game from
start to finish.

*If you go with one Red Mage instead, this is the story*

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

Would be really strong plus backup of black magic spells along with the
occasional heal spell money will be more scarce through the first half with
the Red Mage sucking up Gold for spells.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

Group can be expensive if the player upgrades every chance they have, and it
taking longer for the Red Mage to get spell charges.  The three Fighters
can make up for the lack of spells with fighting anyway.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

fully equipped Knights and Red Wizard.  Equipment distribution will work out
better than it would with a four Fighter party would.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

No Level 8 spells, and a lot of red sprites on the right side of the screen.
No true weaknesses, you may find the boredom of smashing everything that
crosses your path into oblivion.


                  o-----------------------------------o
                  | Fighter/Thief/Red Mage/Black Mage |
                  o-----------------------------------o

Although a party shown in the FF1 manual as an example, this group is more
or less now referred to as the "8-Bit Theater party" by devotees of the said
web comic.  If you choose this party, do not be surprised that you will never
see mentioning of "Sword chucks, yo!" nor "Hadouken!" nor "I Like Swords".

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

Two Black Magic users, two characters who can fight respectably, three
characters that can escape from battle occasionally, and four different types
of party members.  High attack power from the Fighter, decent attack power
from the Red Mage, and an extra shot of Black magic from the Black Mage.  Once
Level 3 spells are bought, you can start blasting through many groups of
monsters.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

The Thief can't fight decently until after you get the Dragon/Coral Swords.
Even then, the Fighter and Red Mage will do much more damage.  Lots of money
will go towards the Red Mage and Black Mage for the spells.  The Red Mage
will likely be in position 2, which has lower Absorb than a Fighter.  Be
cautious.  Also the Red Mage cannot learn the Life spell until promotion, so
good care should be taken to prevent deaths.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

Money will be an issue for the first half of the game coming from buying
upgrades and spells for the Red Mage and Black Mage.  After promotion, most
money found will go to spells and limited armor.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

The Thief becoming a Ninja, which will make the character infinitely useful.
With better Absorb than the Red Wizard, the Ninja takes up position 2.  You
will also have three characters with the Fast spell, so after one round you
can start hitting with three characters for higher damage.  Red Wizard can
cast Exit and Life now, making his wide ranged skills even more so.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

One powerhouse, two ok physical attackers, and then the Black Wizard.  The
Black Wizard will become an extra shot of Lit2 or Ice2 for regular battles or
the battle Item user.  The Ninja will be a stronger attacker than the Thief
was, but still not nearly as powerful as a second Fighter or Black Belt would
have been.  With the Ninja's heavy reliance on equipped armor, the Black
Wizard will most likely be the only character with a good amount of armor that
can cast spells in battle.  No usage of the highest level White Wizard spells
either.

A spellcaster's delight for sure.

                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

Lots of magic.  Lots and lots of magic.  The two Red Mages at the front will
offer good protection for the White Mage and Black Mage at first.  Groups of
monsters can be smashed quickly, especially the undead (Fire and Harm are
your friends).

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

Red Mages strength peak ends abruptly, and then continually lowers in
progression the farther you go into the game.  Money will always be tight
for a long while.  The Red Mages Absorb will start showing its weakness
once you reach the Earth Cave area of the game.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

Constant.  So much money will go for spells throughout the game that even
when you are able to go into the last place, you still probably have several
empty spell slots.  Finding good money making areas is highly recommended.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Lots of magic.  A challenging group compared to similar ones that have a
Fighter (or two) or a Monk.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

Red Wizards are weak in attack compared to a Knight and Monk as well as the
Knight's defense.  One character will be unfortunate to not have a Ribbon
available for being equipped.  Expect lower than maximum Absorb if you
decide to keep a lot of armor that casts spells in battle.  Be prepared for
longer rounds in battles if you are going to fight your way through to
preserve spell charges.  Still be on the lookout for money throughout the
game.

                    o-----------------------------------o

A relatively strong team, they struggle with some key areas through out the
game.  Thanks to "ICE WATER" for this team contribution.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

The Fighter will be a attacking powerhouse, who will be backed up by a the
remaining three dealing decent damage.  The Hit Points for this team will
also be fairly high

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

A lack of hit all magic early on can be a tough thing to deal with when
large groups attacks.  Add onto that how the Red mage will start to become
less powerful, the Black Belt being poor until he reaches the Level 10 area
(he can start bare hand fighting then), and the Thief seems useful for the
sole purpose of running only, and you have a relative tough team to use.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

A fairly expensive team, but only if you spend all of your time attempting
to keep them fully equipped.  However, Black Belts require minimal upkeep,
the Thief will have inexpensive equipment (due to limited choices), and the
Fighter can live off of found equipment from the Marsh Cave onwards.  The Red
Mage will suck up your money for good weapons/armors/magic as you quest
onwards.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Knights will not have changed from their Fighter origins (although they will
gain some low level White Magic charges), and the same can be said for the
Master and Red Wizard, but the big change is your Thief to a Ninja.  He will
have gained some low level Black Magic (including Fast), the ability to use
top of the line weaponry and armor, and the damage dealt will be increased
greatly.  Red Wizard will be able to learn some higher end magic spells as
well.  Money will be far easier to come across though as the dungeons are
much longer and more treasure filled.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

A lack of magic will still be an issue, especially since the Red Wizard can
not learn the powerful Level 8 spells (he can learn Exit though).  The Ninja
will remain a distant third for dealing damage, despite his improvements.

A cheaper team once the first half of the game ends, these guys will garner
lots of physical damage.  Thanks to Casey Wheelwright for this team 
contribution.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

Black Belts as always are cheaper to equip near the start, requiring little
upgrades now and then (most of which is findable as you progress).  Red 
Mages have lots of choices, offering good Magic and physical attacks.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

Black Belts are not able to deliver any significant damage with any 
consistency till Level 10, and even then that is over 25% of the way though
the game.  Red Mages have no real weakness to speak of when starting out,
though their growth and defense will abruptly begin to waver around the Earth
Cave.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

Black Belts are cheap, where as Red Mages are the most expensive class.  
Black Belts will require the odd Bracelet as you travel, but that will be 
it.  Red Mages have a multitude of weapons, armors, White Magic, and Black
Magic to buy, which is really expensive.  However, the money you save on the
Black Belts will help to keep the Red Mages fully equipped as your team 
progresses.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Black Belts (Masters) will continue to deal out crazy damage with their 
fists while Red Mages (Wizards) will continue to be very steady in their 
attacks.  Red Mages will also gain some Level 6 and Level 7 spell charges as
well.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

With the Class upgrade, neither one gains any extra stat bonuses.  Red Mages
(Wizards) will not be able to use Level 8 spells of either type of magic, 
and the party will be very dependent upon the two Red Wizards to keep all 
four party members healed and in the fight.


                 o----------------------------------------o
                 | Fighter/Red Mage/White Mage/Black Mage |
                 o----------------------------------------o

A party of redundancy, the extra support in the three main areas of physical
attack, magical attack, and healing magic will extend the abilities of the
three main people via the Red Mage.  Thanks to Cheveyo for the team 
contribution.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

Two dependable attackers (Fighter and Red Mage), two healing mages (White 
Mage and Red Mage)Red, and two offensive mages (Black Mage and Red mage).  
You will not lack for the ability to attack physically or magically, nor 
will you have a tough time healing up the troops after a vicious hit.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

White and Black Mages will both fail to contribute with physical attacks, as
their magic use is limited often in the early portions of the game.  Red
Mages are versatile and Fighters are only around to attack, so they are not
a problem.  Money is perhaps the biggest issue for this squad (see below).

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

Money is VERY tight for a team of this nature, especially in the early 
portions of the game.  Fighters will suck money for that godly (but 
expensive armor), All three Mages will need to have spells for their spell
charges, and the Red Mage will also require some optimum equipment 
(especially since he needs the help more than the Fighter).

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Fighter continues to be a tank of attacking goodness (also able to keep
equipping from found items), so he is set.  The red mage will level off in
all areas, but remain a decent second in every category, which provides some
assistance for the primary role player.  White Mage will learn Exit as well
as some other higher end spells, while the Blackmage does the same with
attack spells as well as becoming a distant third physical attacker with the
Catclaw.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

Money is still a needed commodity for this troupe, as everyone but Fighter
requires a lot of investment to maximize their potentials.  Physical attacks
will also drop in power overall, but this is made up for by a third physical
attacker in the Black Mage.

                   | Fighter/Thief/White Mage/Black Mage |
                   o-------------------------------------o

A party that will gain stength and great ability as the game progresses, 
culminating with a widespread and high reaching team.  Thanks to Sixth Flying
Man for this contribution.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

With both types of magic represented and a strong physical force in the 
Fighter, most enemies will not be able to stand long.  Even the Thief is
helpful with alright fighting ability, able to take down medium to low Hit
Point monsters.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

White and Black Mages will both fail to contribute with physical attacks, as
their magic use is limited often in the early portions of the game.  The 
Thief will essentially service as a punching bag to keep the Mages healthy, 
which is not very helpful in thegrand scheme of things.  The Fighter is a 
Fighter, so he will not be a concern.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

This group will turn out to be fairly expensive, though after the 
Provoka/Elfland area the Thief will not be a concern at all.  As the game 
approaches the midway point, the spells cost a lot but the Fighter will be
up to living off of the findings of the dungeons the team enters.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

Now this is where this team begins to shine.  Instead of having one hard 
hitting team member, the Thief turned Ninja adds in a second choice in this
area.  Speaking of the Knight and Ninja, they will add in some low level 
healing (Knight) and Black Magic Spells (like FAST), augmenting the 
designated spellcasters.  Speaking of the spellcasters, they will be able to
get better weapons and armor, which will help them out while they get those
sweet and highly useful Level 8 spells.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

There are no glaring errors with this party by this point, though a few 
minor quibbles do exist.  The Ninja will still lack some physical damage
(especially in comparison to the Knight), and the two Wizards will cost a 
mint to fully outfit their spells, so the tedious fighting of monsters will
be required to fund their knowledge.


                     o--------------------------------o
                     | Fighter/Fighter/Red Mage/Thief |
                     o--------------------------------o

A group designed around hard hitting physical attacks that maximize the usage
of the highest end weapons in the game. Thanks to J Stone for this 
contribution.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Pros
                             ==================

The two Fighters will be great for attacking whil also absorbing a lot of 
punishment in the top two slots. The Red Mage will provide both black and white
magic, dealing damage as well as healing (while contributing some middle of the
road physicality). The Thief can be used as a support character, distributing
potions and some low to mid range physical damage.

                             ==================
                             Start Of Game Cons
                             ==================

The Thief is an investment in the future, for a better character later, so he 
will not contribute very much in the present, unfortunately.

                                 =========
                                 Moneywise
                                 =========

Money is of some concern for this team, as you will likely want Silver Swords 
for your Fighters and Red Mage, but once the Elfland runaround is done, you can
make due with found Armors and Weapons. Just the Red Mage and his need to have
three spells per level will truly drain the bank accounts consistently.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Pros
                              ================

The most fun thing about this group is its synergy. The two Fighters use the 
best 2 swords in the game (XCalibur and Masamune), the Ninja uses a Katana, 
and the Red Wizard uses the Sun Sword. This means that the four hardest 
hitting weapons in the game will all be in play at the same time. These 
weapons, along with magic from the Red Wizard and the Ninja turn this group
into a very fast and heavy hitting party.

                              ================
                              End Of Game Cons
                              ================

Picking up new Armors will be annoying due to everyone being maxed out in 
slots. The other big Con is, of course, the lack of higher end White and
Black magic.

   miss anything from the game.

   A quick note for you followers of this document; I am going to list
   everything contained within the game, just as I am going to suggest some
   courses of action.  However, you do not need to follow my level
   suggestions for your characters, nor do you need to buy the equipment I
   mention.  It is up to you to judge on what you truly need and do not
   need on your Quest to revive the ORBS!  Also note that the Class Change
   within the game IS IN THE WALKTHROUGH!  Please, no more e-mails on this
   subject as it is located between the first ORB and the second ORB in the
   walkthrough.

Yeah, yeah I know, WHAT AN ORIGINAL TITLE, HUH!?  Anyway, your first job is
to choose yourself a party of four Light Warriors from the 6 possible
character types (see Character and Teams Section for details) as well as
naming each one with a 4 letter name (or just give them random selections
for all I care).  Regardless, once you are done selecting your motley and
inexperienced team, press the A Button to start your quest!

You will be just a few steps south of Coneria, so head on into town to
equip your bare (must be hard to just appear in the wilderness buck naked)
selves with your bankroll of 400 Gold Pieces (where do they store this
abundance of Gold anyway without pockets and the like?).  You will need to
make a trip through the following Shops:

Now, you will definitely need to acquire some Weaponry and Armor first,
which will cost a fair sum (also, do not forget to equip your newfound
clothing!).  However, it will also allow you to defeat monsters around this
town of Coneria for more money to buy other things.  You may want to invest
in some Magic spells (Fire, Lit, Cure, and Harm are excellent buys) and Items
(Heal Potions will recover Hit points, Pure Potions are handy to leach away
poison from the body, and Tents not only recover Hit Points but also give the
option of SAVING in the field!).  Now that you are outfitted, head into the
castle to speak to everyone to learn many interesting facts about the world
you will be exploring.

It is now time to go fight some enemies for Experience!  The battle menu is
how you wage your battles, so it helps to understand what each command does.
FIGHT allows your character to select a target to attack (if the target is
destroyed, they will attack nothing).  MAGIC will allow that character to
choose a spell from their list of bought spells to use (each use will take a
charge away from your reserves for that level).  DRINK will let your
character to use a Heal Potion OR Pure Potion on themselves or a teammate
during battle.  ITEM is of no use to you right now, but later on in the
game, some Items will have special powers that allow them to be used in
battle to cast Magic spells.  RUN is what you will select if you wish to
have a character attempt to escape a battle (note that all Bosses and some
enemies are inescapable!).

Your goal is to gain at least one level through this fighting, although
going to level three is not a bad idea.  If you start to run out of
Hit Points/Spell Charges, head back to Coneria to use the Inn for 30 Gold
Pieces (the enemies you fight will easily cover the price of staying for
you) to refill your Hit Points and Spell Charges 100%.  Also note that the
Gold being won from enemies can be used to purchase more
Items/Magic/Weapons/Armors (whatever you may need and have yet to buy).
When you are finally ready to move on in the game, head outside of Coneria.

You will need to head out of town and start your trek to the north.  You
will continue along the small plains area to pass through a forest and then
a swamp before entering one final forest to get to the building looming in
the distance... THE TEMPLE OF FIENDS!  WHAT UNTOLD HORRORS AWAIT YOUR BAND
AS THEY SET FOOT INSIDE!

                             ------------------
                              Temple Of Fiends
                             ------------------

When you arrive, the man who is in charge of this evil temple lies but a few
steps forward (if you want to fight him, go to the next paragraph).
However, if you wish to do a bit of treasure hunting, strike out to the left
first.  As you go through this narrow passage, you will come to a small
room, so head down and then left to enter through the door (walls do not
make good entry spots after all!).  Open up the Treasure Chest to find a
Cap, which is a nice helmet Armor for a White/Black Mage (if none of those
are in your party, give to a Black Belt or Thief), and be sure to equip it
(it does not work otherwise).  Now exit the room and start going up the path
above, past the right fork to keep going up to find another room (enter
through the door on the bottom once again).  Two Treasure Chests here
contain a Heal Potion and a Cabin (even better than a Tent!).  Now you will
be ready to backtrack to the central chamber of the dungeon as the other two
Treasure Rooms are locked (just like the ones in Coneria were!).  When you
arrive, stride forward to go confront the evil man, who declares he shall
knock you all down (ooooooooooooo!  SO SCARY!)!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~GARLAND~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H.P.: 106

Gold: 250

Exp.: 130

Garland is the first boss of the game, and as such you would expect him to
be a pushover.  However, he is so pathetic that losing to him just should
not happen.  Regardless, here are a few quick thoughts: 1) attack with every
character (except Black Mage/Red Mage who should use Fire/Lit to weaken
him), 2) White Mages can Cure someone if Garland gets lucky enough to land a
few hits on the same person, and 3) You should not lose to this guy as he is
rather weak.

Upon defeating him, step forward to pass the bats to talk to Princess Sara!
She will somehow magically transport you back to the castle (then why did
she not do so before!?) where the Light Warriors should step forward to
speak to the King.  He will be so overjoyed at your rescue effort that he
will get his workmen to construct a bridge to the main continent!  To follow
this up, Sara will show her undying gratitude to the Light Warriors by
bestowing a fabulous gift upon them!  Gold?  Jewels? Her hand in marriage?
NO!  You get an old, beat up, barely holding together LUTE!  Well, that is
better than nothing so you better take it and hold onto it, as it just may
"come in handy".  Regardless, now that you are done with this part of your
quest, it is time to head back into Coneria to stock up and sleep at the
Inn before heading outside again to go north to cross the bridge (enjoy the
credits and great music before continuing on to the next section!)


                         o------------------------o
                         | For The Want Of A Ship |
                         o------------------------o

Knowing that the world is not going to be able to be just walked across, the
Light Warriors will need to be able to get themselves a sailing vessel to
increase their range of travel as they attempt to revive the ORBS.  However,
our first stop will be to the north where a crazy witch named Matoya lives,
so shall we set out?

Head along the coast here (to your left) to pass a port and enter a forest.
Turn west to go along the river, followed by heading northeast to go through
the thick forest to find a cave!

                               ---------------
                                Matoya's Cave
                               ---------------

Upon entering, head left to find a walking and talking Broom who has this
little tidbit for you: "....TCELES B HSUP   A magic spell?"  Well, that is WAY
too tough to crack (well not really, but if you do struggle with it, read
the capitalized bit backwards), followed by entering the door to the right.
Inside are: more talking Brooms, three treasure Chests (one Pure Potion, two
Heal Potions), and a witch named Matoya.  Talk to her to learn that she is
blind without her CRYSTAL (captialized names ALWAYS lead to something, so
keep it in mind).  Exit on out of the cave as you are done here... for now.

Now you are ready to leave once again, and continue east, away from
Coneria!  Backtrack to the southwest, turn east after you pass the second
stream in the river, and then continue east through the desert to enter a
forest.  Continue east across this wide expanse of forest to enter a plain
briefly before trekking into another forest where your party should start
off in a southern direction.  You will come across a port town, which you
should enter immediately.

                                  ---------
                                   Pravoka
                                  ---------

Things are not looking so great as you enter this town (maybe the first guy
you see says "Help!" tipped us off?), so head straight up to a grassy area
to find out Pirates have taken the town!  If you need to fill up your Hit
Points/Spell Charges, enter the Inn and shell out 50 Gold Pieces.
Otherwise, head left to see a suspicious fellow who looks like a Pirate and
talk to him.  His name is Bikke and he happens to be a Pirate Captain, but
he is also rather cowardly so he will sic his entire Pirate Crew on you!

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~PIRATE~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

H.P.: 6

Gold: 40

Exp.: 40

WOW!  NINE OF THE WEAKEST GUYS YOU CAN IMAGINE!  Imps have more Hit Points
for goodness sake!  Anyway, have everyone attack, having Black Mage use Fire
or Lit if you want to assure a Pirate dies at the Black Mage's hands (as
opposed to risking it on his weapon).  Spread your attacks out so the
attacks will not be wasted, and just cut them down one by one.  Also note
that White Mage or Red Mage should use Cure if they gang up on an ally (not
too likely as they are weak attackers as well).

After this "upset battle" has happened, be sure to talk to Bikke again to
gain the use of his Pirate Ship (you should think it odd that he would just
give it away, but then again you just trounced and slaughtered his entire
"Crack Pirate Crew" after all).


                 o----------------------------------------o
                 | Elfish Trials And The Great Items Swap |
                 o----------------------------------------o

Now that you have gained transport, your next duty is to look into upgrading
your equipment as well as looking into the Item Shop and the new Magic Shops
that are in Pravoka!  Note that Dark and Tmpr spells are both bugged and do
not work as they should, so do not purchase them.

Once you are all ready to leave town, head out through the southern exit on
the main path (the only exit actually) to see your new Ship sitting in the
harbour!  before climbing onto it, a few rules to know about the Ship; 1) It
can not go down streams (differently coloured than oceans), and 2) You may
only disembark at a port (or with a Canoe, but you are not that far yet in
the game).  Anyway, head out of the small bay and head west along the coast
line, turning south when the ocean opens up.  Continue south and west along
the coast to find a port near a large forest.  Land on shore and head south
through the forest to find the central point of the kingdom of Elfland!

                                  ---------
                                   Elfland
                                  ---------

You should visit the castle first to learn of many things (including a
sleeping Prince who needs the HERB because Astos put him to sleep, but
Matoya has HERB but needs the CRYSTAL, and no one knows where Astos is!).
Following that info overload, you should visit town to see what the new
upgrades in Weapons, Armors and Magics that are available!  Note that Lok2
is a bugged spell, doing the reverse of what it is supposed to do, so do
not purchase it.

As you can see, lots of expensive stuff, but it is mostly useful.  Use this
time to save money to buy this equipment as you gain experience and levels
(for they will be needed for your dangerous treks coming up).  Now for the
areas to gain Gold and Experience:

  i) The first place is on the open sea.  Although the experience is not
     superb, you can gain some quick Gold from groups of Sahags (possibly a
     R. Sahag if you are lucky), Sharks, and Kyzoku (120 Gold each).

 ii) Ogres & Creeps, Geists, and GrOgres to the east of Elfland are great
     sources of funds and Experience.

iii) For this one to work, Fir2 is a must for ease of victory (Hrm2 can also
     be very beneficial).  Once you have Fir2 (or both), head to Pravoka, go
     east to pass through the various mountainous areas, and then turn north
     to walk out onto the peninsula.  On the last four squares, crazy
     powerful enemies patrol, bringing lots of Experience and Gold with the
     risk these enemies pose.  Bring a few Cabins/Tents to save after every
     fight.  Remember that ZomBulls are ideal to fight as they are weak to
     both Fire and Harm spells (otherwise Harm is no good), but Trolls and
     FrWolves are also good (just note that FrWolves can be deadly in large
     packs).

Once you have gained enough Gold and Experience to satisfy your comfort
level with your party (Level 7 to Level 9 is the usual area to be ready at),
you should also concern yourself on getting a supply of around 10 Pure
Potions and 30 Heal Potions (suggested area, go higher or lower as you see
fit) for your trek, to through, and back through the Marsh Cave.  A House
may also be a very good investment for the steep 3000 Gold Pieces it
commands.

Head west along the mountain as you trek through the forest, turning
northwest when a passage between two mountains appear.  Continue past the
field to your left to go north past two rivers to find the...

                             ------------------
                              Northwest Castle
                             ------------------

The fellow inside is so touched that he will help you with the Elfen Prince,
but he requires the CROWN first from the Marsh Cave!

Go south again to turn west through the narrow passage before turning south.
You will continue south along the coast as you enter a marsh, and you will
soon see a hole in the ground (your destination!).  Use a Cabin to recover
your lost Hit Points from the trek to the Cave, save the game, and then set
foot into the Marsh Cave!

                                ------------
                                 Marsh Cave
                                ------------

A tough cave, I highly suggest running from all but the easiest battles.
Note that Scums are very resistant to weapons, so use magic attacks if you
wish to kill them easier.  The walkthrough will cover the paths and rooms
that have Treasure for you to grab (ignoring the locked rooms for now).

Head up and to the right, followed by going left.  Now head up and to the
right along the winding path to finally reach a direction going left to the
stairs leading downwards.  Head up and to the right to enter the room there
to find a Large Dagger (give to a Black mage if you did not buy one for him
originally), then exit the room to go to the left to enter the large room to
find 680 Gold Pieces in a Treasure Chest.  Now head down to the bottom of
the floor to find a big room where two Treasure Chests sit (Short Sword in
the left one and 620 Gold Pieces in the right one), which you will then
follow up by exiting the room to go back up the stairs and return to the
start of the cave.

Head down through the narrow passage to find a fork, so take the fork
leading downwards to find a room that contains a ladder leading downwards.
Head downwards from the room you start in until you hit the bottom border,
followed by turning right to go into the first door you happen upon.  Inside
this room you will quickly cut right to exit the room through the next door
and head down the stairs to the next floor below.

Head straight down, turn right and enter the room to find Iron Armor in the
Treasure Chest, and then exit the room to go right past the next two rooms
(as they are empty) to enter the third room to find 295 Gold Pieces.  Now
you should head left till you see a room ahead, so cut down past the next
room to find another room to enter to get 385 Gold Pieces from a Treasure
Chest.  Exit the room and start to the left to enter a room where a Treasure
Chest will have all access points to it blocked off except for the bottom
one.  This is the sign for you to completely fill your Hit Points before
stepping forward to fight the guardians of the CROWN that you seek!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~WIZARDS~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H.P.: 84

Gold: 300

Exp.: 276

You will have to face any amount of these tough guys from as two of them to
as high as four of them.  They are tough, they hit for lots of Damage, and
they have one weakness that barely is a weakness.  Have your Fighter
concentrate his attacks on one individual Wizard (his Silver Sword should be
good enough to cut one down), have your Black Belt/Thief/Red Mage/White Mage
concentrate on attacking another for a chance of taking it down, and if you
have a Black Mage, cast Lit2 as it can potentially wipe the entire Wizard
party out in one shot.  After one round of battle, refocus your attacks to
take out the weakened Wizards, have your White Mage/Red Mage break out the
Cure spells, and use a Lit spell from your Black Mage instead of his
laughable attack abilities.

Upon defeating these enemies, MAKE SURE TO GRAB THE CROWN!  If you step off
of the square, you will have to step back up and battle the Wizards AGAIN!
Once you have successfully obtained the Crown, exit the room, turn left, and
then start upwards to then cut left to the next room on the left to find a
Copper Bracelet sitting in a Treasure Chest.  Now exit the room to go up
again to turn left and go up the stairs to exit the floor.  Go through the
room to move left along the bottom of the floor area until you see the room
above (go up past it on the left).  Enter the room you arrive at and take
the ladder up a floor.  Exit the room and follow the left wall as you go up
to find the stairs that lead to the outside world!

Now that you have escaped, quickly return to the Northwest Castle to
exchange the CROWN for some help for the Elfen Prince.  Head up along the
coast until you see a plain path between the mountains leading east (take
it).  As soon as the northern mountain allows, cut north past the two
streams to stop just outside of the Northwest Castle to use your House and
save the game, followed by going inside.

                             ------------------
                              Northwest Castle
                             ------------------

You should head straight for the Throne Room to find the out kindly
benefactor is in fact the ONE WHO CURSED THE ELFEN PRINCE!  He is the King
of the Dark Elves, the almighty Astos!  He will then decide to slaughter you
because you have served your purpose of getting the CROWN for him!

~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~ASTOS~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~

H.P.: 168

Gold: 2000

Exp.: 2250

Astos will be a different type of battle as compared to what you have fought
before, mainly because he has good Magic and he does not mind using it!  He
has Rub (one hit kills), Slow (halves your Hits total), Fast (doubles his Hits 
total), and Fir2 (hurts your entire party)!  His attack is not that strong, so
physical attacks from him are not a worry, but he does have a fairly good
Absorb rating.  Have Fighter/Black Belt/Thief/ attack all of the time, have
Red Mage/Black Mage cast Fast on the physical attackers (gets them to land
more hits for more damage), and White Mage can attack unless some Cures are
needed.  Astos should not last longer than three rounds.

Now that you have been victorious, you will obtain the CRYSTAL that he had
stolen from Matoya!  You should now head back to Elfland to get back onto
your Ship.  Head south past the two streams to go in southeasterly
direction along the mountain, turning to a straight east course after
passing through the narrow opening in the two mountains.  You will find
Elfland, so stop at the Inn if you wish, sell your excess Weapons/Armor from
the Marsh Cave, buy anything you wish to purchase, and then head outside to
the Ship to set sail for Matoya's Cave!

Move your ship east till you hit the coast, turn north and continue along
that settings until you reach Coneria's shores.  Here you will follow the
coast northeast, followed by turning west to pass under the bridge that was
built for you (remember that?) to then go north to dock at the small port.
Head north past the mountains, turn west to follow the river, and then walk
northeast to find Matoya's Cave.

                               ---------------
                                Matoya's Cave
                               ---------------

Go talk to her to exchange her CRYSTAL for the HERB for the Elfen Prince,
and then leave.

Backtrack through the directions above to return to Elfland, this time you
will enter the castle.

                                  ---------
                                   Elfland
                                  ---------

Go to the Throne Room and talk to the attendant to give him the HERB, which
will wake the sleeping prince!  He will be so grateful, he will bestow upon
your party the mystic KEY!  Now you can go open all of the locked doors that
have blocked you on your journey thus far!  Please note that the optional
places to visit will now be listed below, with the booty that you missed,
allowing you to make any decisions you wish regarding the grabbing of it at
this time.

  i)The first place to go is within this very castle.  Backtrack to the
    entrance of the castle, go right and then up around the border of the
    castle to find a small room that contains: Silver Hammer, 400 Gold
    Pieces, 330 Gold Pieces, and a Copper Gauntlet.  Distribute the
    equipment  among your people and sell the excess.

 ii)Northwest Castle will be your next stop (refer to earlier instructions
    in the FAQ on how to locate it).  When you enter the castle, go up the
    right side of the castle, turning left to go across the area past the
    throne room, and then go down to walk to the door to the room.  If you
    want to avoid the set guards for each chest, open them from the side of
    Treasure Chests.  Regardless, you will gain the following booty:
    Falchon, Iron Gauntlet, and Power Staff.

iii)The Marsh cave is next up (again refer to the FAQ for directions), so go
    inside, go down two floors (more FAQ referral) if you are confused to
    arrive on the bottom floor.  Here you will need to go right past the
    first room, followed by cutting straight downwards until you run into a
    room.  Go to the left and enter the door, and then follow the exact
    steps to avoid a Wizard and Cobra Fight (from the door for reference:
    Up two spaces, Right two spaces, Down two spaces, and then right two
    spaces to get a Silver Bracelet from the Treasure Chest.  Now re-trace
    your steps, and head back out of the room.

    Go above that room, head right till you see another room coming up, and
    then go down to find the door and enter to find a Treasure Chest.  This
    time you must decide between Wizards (to the left of the Treasure Chest)
    or Cobras (to the bottom of the Treasure Chest), and after the fight you
    will get a Silver Knife.  Exit the chamber, go up and then right to pass
    the next room you see, entering the second one you come across.  Here
    you will need to fight Wizards (same rules from the CROWN fight apply)
    for the 1020 Gold Pieces contained within the Treasure Chest.

 iv)Now you will be ready to go tackle the Temple of Fiends locked rooms, so
    head for Coneria from Elfland (go straight north and you will find it).
    Now walk northwest from Coneria to find the Temple of Fiends.  Take the
    passage to the right, enter the small room, and fight the Gargoyles for
    the Rune Sword.  Now exit the room, head up to the top right corner of
    the chamber, and enter the small room there to fight more Gargoyles
    (twice) for a Were Sword and a Soft Potion.

Now that you are ready to advance on in the story, you will want to go to
Coneria to clean out their locked Treasure vaults.  Head to the back area
of the castle, go through the small passage that leads right and then down,
and then enter the two rooms to find the following Treasures: Sabre, Iron
Staff, Silver Knife, Iron Shield, Iron Armor, and the TNT.  Now you can
break the land blocking your passage to the open sea, and you will need to
go see the Dwarves!

Head up the coast to the left of Coneria and keep following the coast till
you find a port to land at.  Head west past the small lake, cut south along
the mountain, and then enter the Dwarf Cave!

                                ------------
                                 Dwarf Cave
                                ------------

Take a tour and pick up a couple Treasure Chests while you learn a few neat
things, including how something called ADAMNAT would make a super strong
sword!  Regardless, head down to the bottom areas of the cave to find Nerrick
the Dwarf, who happens to need the TNT to finish his digging!  He will go
blast the ground away, letting the inland sea connect to the open sea, and
be sure to raid his Treasure Room for the following Treasures: Cabin, Iron
Helmet, Dragon Sword, Silver Knife, Wooden Helmet, Silver Armor, 575 Gold
Pieces, and a House.


Head on outside, go back to your ship, sail along the coast (the side closer
to the Dwarf Cave), and strike out west through the opening!


                           o--------------------o
                           | The Troubled Earth |
                           o--------------------o

Follow the islands that greet you in the open sea to find a port near a
town. Enter the town to scope out the new wares as well as find out what has
been happening in this area of the world.

                                  ---------
                                   Melmond
                                  ---------

You will notice a few things in this town, including: The earth is in horrid
shape, people are sick, the Vampire destroyed the Clinic (no reviving fallen
comrades) AND Item Shop (no stocking up for long ventures into the field of
battle), and the famous Dr. Unne lives in this town.  After you have had your
quick walk through town, it is time to sample the local wares (note that Hel2 
is a bugged spell, but in a good manner explained in the Secrets/Oddities 
section):

You will have amassed a nice bankroll form your repeated trips here and
there in the previous section, collecting a very nice pile of treasure.
Some good buys include: Fir3, Warp (will have to come back later with
Wizards for this one), Bane (if you feel lucky), ANY of the White Magic
spells (look into not getting Hel2 if you want all four), Silver Bracelets
for White Mage/Black Mage (great armor for them), and Steel Armor (if you
want to spend the massive amount of money, your Fighter will be hard pressed
to avoid an attack, but he will be near impervious to physical attacks).
Whenever you have finished up your shopping spree, you will be ready enough
to make a few ventures into the Earth Cave that resides nearby.  The Vampire
is rumoured to live there, so set out to find his evil lair and end his days
of terrorizing Melmond!

Head off to the west to start, heading southwest along the coast line.  once
you reach a small land bridge leading south, take it to get onto a large
peninsula where your party should go south and then turn east to walk
towards the cave mouth.  Step foot through that portal to enter the dank...

                                ------------
                                 Earth Cave
                                ------------

A quick note about this cave, if you go straight to the left from the start,
you will find the legendary "Hall Of Giants", where every step will bring at
least one Giant to fight you each time!  They will often be accompanied by
an Iguana or two.  This is a great place to build your Experience quickly,
so make use of it as you see fit.

To start your journey through this Cave, your first job is to clean out the
Treasure Chests on this floor.  Start off by walking to the upwards branch
of the cave to follow it to the dead-end to find a room where 1975 Gold
Pieces are yours form a Treasure Chest.  This is the first place you can
fight an Earth, so I will now cover the strategy for fighting these
massively strong Room guardians (you can avoid this one by going below the
Treasure Chest though).  Also note that any time you need the info for
fighting an Earth, come back to this spot or check the Bosses section.

These guys can hit your characters for a TON of damage, so avoiding fights
with them is recommended.  That being said, running from them is not an
option, so take them on with everything you got to end the fight quickly.
They do have one weakness, and that is to Fire, so Fir2 and Fir3 will really
damage them badly.  Otherwise, go to work with your weaponry to take them
out as soon as possible, thusly not allowing them to pound on your team too
badly.  If your allies start to look weak, use a Cur2 or Cur3 to get them
back up to snuff thanks to your White Mage/Red Mage.

Once you have finished with this task, return to the starting area for the
floor, this time choosing the path leading down that is on the right side of
the area.  You will arrive at a fork, so head right and then down to find a
room with two Treasure Chests.  Walk left as soon as you enter the room and
approach the two Treasure Chests from below to avoid the Earth guardian (go
up top if you want to tangle with the Earth Guardian) to get the Pure Potion
and 795 Gold Pieces before returning to the fork.  Now head left, ignoring
the first path leading down to take the next path leading down to find a
room that holds two Treasure Chests.  The right one holds a Heal Potion
(grab it form the side or face an Earth), and the left one holds 880 Gold
Pieces.  Now make your way back to the center area, take the right passage,
and then go down the stairs.

Move through the hole below, go right to the next hole and through it (up),
and then go right to go through the hole below.  Head through the next hole
below, followed by going right through the one choice passages, and then
head right to enter the room.  Here you will walk up the left wall to get a
Coral Sword, then go right one step to get a Cabin, and then go right one
step and down one step to get 330 Gold Pieces before leaving the room.  Go
through the hole below, take the left passage downwards to find a room where
you will have to fight an Earth Guardian to get in!  After fighting, walk up
to open the two Treasure Chests to get a Wooden Shield and 575 Gold Pieces
before opening the last Treasure Chest to get 5000 Gold Pieces.  Now go
battle the Earth as you leave the room, backtrack up the long passage to
where the fork was, and this time head down the right fork to follow it's
winding path to find the stairs leading downwards.

Head along the wall below, going right to find a room with a Tent (go
straight up, grab it, and leave to avoid the Earth Guardian).  Now head left
to get back on the main path, go up the path until a choice presents itself,
at which point you should send your party up, right, and then  down to find
a room with a Heal Potion inside a Treasure Chest before returning to the
main path.  Go left to enter the next room, go straight up and open the
treasure Chest for 3400 Gold Pieces, and then go back outside to continue to
the left until you see a room.  Ignore that room as you start downwards,
take the right path to enter a room, battle the Earth, and then grab the
1020 Gold Pieces from the Treasure Chest.  Head down and then right to enter
a large room where a mysterious figure blocks your path...

Here is the terror of Melmond and he is all ready to go to battle with you!
He brings a decent attack power and his special ability called Dazzle (Stun)
to knock your party down for good!  He is undead, so of course Harm and Fire
spells will clean his clock (one shot of Fir2, Hrm2, Fir3, or Hrm3 are often
enough to knock him down immediately!)!  The rest of the party should
concentrate on attacking this monstrosity and erasing him from existence.
use a Cure spell if he badly damages one of your party members.

Go up and grab the RUBY from the Treasure Chest, which is what you will need
soon enough!  However, your passage through the cave for now is blocked by a
heavy Metal Plate and a sense of evil lies underneath (maybe the Vampire is
not the true evil here?).  Regardless, you should now backtrack and exit the
cave, followed by a trip to Melmond to use the Inn.  Once you have done
this, the next step in this area shall be embarked upon!

Head west across the marshy expanse, this time continuing west instead of
turning south to the peninsula.  When you hit the patch of forest, head
southwest between two mountains to pass through a small forest on your way
to enter the Titan's Tunnel!

                              ----------------
                               Titan's Tunnel
                              ----------------

Head up and then left to find the Titan blocking the path.  He demands a
RUBY, and you just so happen to have found after creaming the Vampire!  Now
you may pass through, so head left and then down the windy path to find a
room.  Go in to find a Great Axe, 620 Gold Pieces, 450 Gold Pieces, and a
Silver Helmet before you head back up the path to take the stairs out of the
tunnel.

Head south along the path to then turn east before finally moving southwest
to enter Sarda's Cave!

                               --------------
                                Sarda's Cave
                               --------------

You have a simple task here, and that is to go see Sarda and receive the
ROD!  This Item will allow your party to journey further into the depths of
the Earth Cave to find the true power behind the massive rot of the earth
that is taking place around Melmond.

Now you should return to Melmond, buy anything you may need, keeping in mind
that a trip to Coneria may be necessary to raid the Item Shop for Heal
Potions, Pure Potions, or Tents (go to Elfland if you need a Cabin/House).
Once you are all prepared, head back to the scary confines of the Earth
Cave!

                                ------------
                                 Earth Cave
                                ------------

Take the path to the right to quickly go down a floor.  Go down, go right,
and then go up before walking right to go down through the next portal.
After passing through the hole below, go right through the various holes
until you see a room to the right, at which point you will head downwards to
find a fork.  Take the right fork and follow the path the entire way to
find the stairs leading down to the next floor.  Move on to the right, taking
the first path up until a fork presents itself.  head left, then down, then
right, and then down to enter the former room of the Vampire.  Head up the
path to arrive at the heavy stone plate, so go into your Items and use the
ROD to shatter the plate, revealing the stairway below!

You will notice the rot is even MORE pronounced here, as are the roving
groups of enemies that tend to team up on the Light Warriors, so keep your
Hit Points high.  Anyway, head up the path to the left, continue through
the next segment by going up again, then down, and then left to pass through
the hole above.  You will have arrived at the room, so go inside to face some
Sphinxes while you empty the Treasure Chests of the following prizes: Wooden
Staff, 3400 Gold Pieces, 1520 Gold Pieces, 5450 Gold Pieces, and 1455 Gold
Pieces.

Now exit the room, backtrack through the next three chambers, and then head
right through a hole.  Head down through the hole below, turn left to go
down through the next room, and then head left through the next three holes
before moving up and left through the next two holes.  Now go down the windy
path to find a room with three treasure Chests inside.  Go step in front of
the left-most one to grab the Cabin (the side has a set enemy trap), then go
grab the right-most Treasure Chest by standing to its side (the front has a
 set enemy trap), and then grab the top one by standing to the side of it
(the front has a set enemy trap) to get the 1250 Gold Pieces it hold before
leaving the room.  Head back up the path, continuing along the upwards path
(always choosing the left-most door possible) to find a set of stairs
leading downward.

Now you have arrived on the final floor of the dungeon, so be ready for
anything.  There are no Treasure Rooms down here, so we can go straight for
the goal on this floor (YAY!).  Move down and then go right to go up through
the next four holes in the wall (you will reach a wall directly above you).
Now turn left and take the next passage leading downwards, walk left, and
then walk up to enter the chamber ahead.  Before moving forward to examine
the dark orb ahead, stop to completely refill your Hit Points.  Why, you
ask?  Well the answer is simple my friends, YOU HAVE FOUND THE FIEND OF
EARTH!

~~~~~~~~~~
~~~LICH~~~

Lich is the first fiend so he is of course the weakest of the four.  However,
he does have a fairly good attack power (he can stun the person he attacks),
spells like Ice2 (hits your entire party) and Slep (can knock members out of
the fight for a while), and he can land multiple hits as well.  That being
said, Lich is classified as undead, so Fire and harm spells will slaughter
his Hit points (therefore he can die from one blast each of Fir3 and Hrm3).
You have two options, both of which depend on how you wish to fight the
battle.  Have your Mages go all out and cast Fire and Harm, leaving your
weapon users to remove meager amounts of Hit Points (Lich DOES have a high
Absorb rating), OR have your Red Mage and Black Mage cast Fast on the
weapon users to take him down physically (the first method is likely
preferred, but it requires you to save your spell charges as you trek
through the cave).  Not a very hard fight, but Lich can kill a party member
of yours off quickly.

After defeating the fiend, step forward to touch the altar that he was
protecting, which will cause an ORB to shine!  Now continue forward to use
the warp there to return to the outside world!  Now you just need to return
to Melmond in the northeast, sell any excess stuff you found, and then get
ready to head off to your next challenge!

              o---------------------------------------------o

For this section, you will need to find your way to Crescent Lake, which is
followed up by the choice indicated in the section title.  The walkthrough
will cover my personal preferred method, but you can do the other method
with the walkthrough (the order of the dungeons will need to be looked at
properly by you the reader).  You will should do all three to complete the
game (note that the Castle Of ordeals is optional, but highly recommended),
so it is not a huge deal, although certain advantages lie in all methods.

As stated, we are going off to Crescent Lake, so set sail from Melmond when
you are ready to head out.  Head south from Melmond and follow the
peninsula to it's tip, followed by turning west to follow that direction
until you reach land.  Now steer your Ship down the coast slightly to find a
port to land at.  You will now have to hike into Crescent Lake, so head
southwest to find Crescent Lake.  Now you should head east underneath the
lake, followed by cutting east to enter into the town itself.

                               ---------------
                                Crescent Lake
                               ---------------

Now you have an entire new town from which to purchase some new things and
gain information, BUT you should visit the Circle of Sages that are
mentioned first.  Head up through town to pass between the two Magic Shops,
and then head right through the twisting path to find the Circle of Sages.
Talk to each of them to learn various facts (some useful, some utterly
useless) about the Four Fiends, and be sure to visit the Sage two to the
right of the spot you enter the Circle to receive the CANOE!  Now your party
will have the ability to travel down rivers to reach previously inaccessible
areas!

Now that you are done with the Sages, it is time to make like a rich High
School girl and SPEND SPEND SPEND!

Once you have finally finished accessorizing and learning spells, it is time
to decide which of the following scenarios you wish to follow for the game.

  i) The first place to journey to will be the Castle of Ordeals in the
     north, then the Ice Cave, and finally onto Gurgu Volcano (this is the
     path I recommend and follow for this FAQ, but it is not a mandatory
     decision).

 ii) Same as the above option, except that the Ice Cave comes first,
     followed by going north to the Castle of Ordeals, and THEN onto Gurgu
     Volcano.

iii) Start with the Gurgu Volcano (take on the second Fiend), then the Ice
     Cave and Castle of Ordeals.

The first option will be the one followed for this FAQ as it offers the best
chances for leveling, Gold, and it also affords an easier trip through the
very tough Gurgu Volcano (for a couple of reasons).  Regardless, let us now
set out to the Castle Of Ordeals (bring along a couple Houses for the trip)!

You will need to hike back to your Ship, but this time you can row east
across the lake with your new Canoe, followed by moving northeast along the
coast to find your Ship at the port you left it at.

Head north, following the coast on your left until you reach the peninsula
of the continent (it happens to be the Power Peninsula as well).  You can
head south on the other side of the peninsula to find a port, which is
the last spot available to the Light Warriors to stop and get supplies (by
hiking west to Pravoka) before going into the north where no ports exist
(your Ship can still land though on the mouth of a river by disembarking on
your Canoe however).  Once you are ready, it is time to move west until you
are just to the north of the Temple of Fiends (use your B + SELECT to see
the World Map).  Once you are there, head north until you hit some land.
You will then go north along the western coast of this land mass, and you
will soon see a Castle to the east, surrounded by marsh (this is your goal).
Continue north along the coast until you find a small river leading inland,
which is where you will disembark from your ship as you Canoe south on the
river.  Leave the river when it bends and continue south on foot until you
reach the Castle of ordeals, at which point you should make use of a House
to fully refill your Hit points and Spell Charges before setting foot
inside!

                             -------------------
                              Castle Of Ordeals
                             -------------------

Move forward to show the old man your CROWN as it is required for entering
the upper levels of the Castle to prove your courage.  Bring back something
form the upper floors and save it for a time that proof of courage is
required.  Head to the up-right corner of the floor and set foot onto the
throne to start your journey!

For this floor, you will need to touch the proper pillar to advance to the
next room.  Just make sure to touch the right one when presented a choice or
you will have to start over at the beginning spot on the floor!  The first
two rooms have one pillar only, so go touch them to warp forward.  The third
room has two, so choose the bottom one.  The fourth room has one choice,
which leads to the fifth room that has two (choose the bottom one).  The
sixth room is a long hall leading down to a single pillar, which is followed
by room seven where the right pillar is the one to choose to advance.  Here
you will need to move right, enter the room you see, and step forward in
front of the Treasure Chest to enter a fight!

You will face one or two of these guys, and they are fairly dangerous.  They
have a high damage stat, and that can be furthered by their special ability
of using Fast!  They have no real weak point so attack them with your
weaponry and strongest Magic attacks to take them down before they can use
their brutal attacking abilities.

After you have finished up with the baddies, open up the Treasure Chest to
find the Zeus Gauntlet, which is not only a good Gauntlet for a
Fighter/Knight, Red Wizard, or Ninja, but it also has the honour of being
the first Weapon/Armor that you have found that can be used as an Item in
battle and have an effect.  When used as an Item, it will cast Lit2 every
time!  Give it to a weaker physical attacker, which will allow them to deal
more damage and to more people (thus making them a bigger help to your
party)!

Anyway, Now head out the door, take the path down ON THE LEFT (not the one
directly below the door), and then touch the lower pillar of the two here
to appear in the room with the stairway leading to the next floor!

Head up the hallway to the left to pass through a door to enter a fight!

~~~NITEMARE~~~

Gold: 700

You will face off against one or two unicorn wannabes in the Nitemares.
They are not particularly strong attacker, and their only special ability is
to Snort (Dark spell).  They have a weakness to Ice, so let them have it
with Ice2 while the rest of the party attacks, and you will quickly win this
fight!

Go open the Treasure Chest above to get a Heal Staff (when used as an Item
in battle, it will cast Heal on your entire party so it is useful for
keeping the Hit points up for no cost to your spell charges), followed by
going through the narrow hall to the left.  You will come across three
Treasure Chests that hold an Iron Gauntlet, Ice Sword (give to your Fighter
or Red Mage), and a Gold Bracelet (give to a Mage).  Next step is to head
down the hall below to find four treasure Chests holding 7340 Gold Pieces,
1455 Gold Pieces, a house, and NOTHING (ie it is empty)!  Now head right to
open the Treasure Chest near the throne to find the TAIL!  This is your
proof of courage, so you can now use the throne to leave!  However, you will
first have to fight for the "honour" of leaving!

~~~ZOMBIE DRAGON~~~

H.P.: 268

Gold: 999

Exp.: 2331

You will have to brawl with a couple undead Dragons that have a high attack
power (they can also stun your fighters with their attack)!  Since they are
undead, Fire and harm spells will just decimate them, so do not be shy in
handing out some of those spell charges!  Otherwise, attack away with
physical weapons and cut them down, remembering to use Cure from your Mages
if needed.

Once you are victorious, you may wish to step away and then repeat the fight
with the Zombie D's.  However, only do so if you have a lot of Fire/Harm
spell charges to make the battles easier (it gains you experience relatively
quickly).  Once you have had your fill of the Zombie D's, step forward
onto the throne and warp back to the first floor.  Head down and to the
right to exit the Castle Of ordeals, at which point you should use a Tent or
Cabin or House to save your deeds!

Head north to find your Ship, followed by going west it pass underneath the
land to the north.  Now head north until you arrive at a land mass, at which
point moving east along the coast will take you past a desert (remember it
as it is highly important in a bit) to find the coast heads north.  Now
follow this change to stop at the mouth of the river, canoe to shore, and
then head north to Crescent lake to restock your supplies and buy some
things (if needed) as well as staying at the Inn.

Once you are done, retrace your path back to your Ship on the mouth of the
river, head north along the coast, past the first port and enter the natural
harbour area to drop anchor on the mouth of a river to the southwest of a
nearby port.  Now you will be transporting by Canoe into the next challenge,
so be sure to be ready to fight River monsters!

Follow the stream till the branch appears, taking the northwest route.
Follow that current route, turning east and following it east past the fork
leading up.  Head south to take the west fork, and then follow that waterway
to dry land once again.  Head east and then north to find the entrance of
the Ice Cave!  Be sure to use a Tent (at least a Tent anyway) before
entering as the challenge inside is very harsh indeed.

                                 ----------
                                  Ice Cave
                                 ----------

Far and away the toughest challenge yet, this cave will bring lots of heavy
hitters, damaging floor sections, undead stunners, status killers, and one
hit killers.  Bring 99 Heal Potions, around 5 to 15 Soft Potions, and your
ability to run as much as possible so you can to get through alive!

Head right from the entrance along the top wall, cutting down when the
passage opens up below, and then cut left to find a stairway leading
downwards.  This floor offers a choice as your party will need to go left
and then down to find the stairs OR down and then left to find the stairs.
This floor is pretty simple, but I will tell you to walk to the other visible
staircase on the small walking area.

Now you will have a big room to walk around the edge of until you find a
door to pass through to find a room where holes and some Treasure Chests
sit.  Walk around the holes to get the Treasure Chest on the right to get
into a fight!

Gold: 1095

Exp.: 1095

These guys will show up in any number from 1 to 4, and they are incredibly
dangerous with their attack spells (Fir2, Lit2, Ice2, Rub, Stun).  However,
they are rather weak, so attack with a vengeance and be sure to spread out
the attacks and use a hard hitting attack spell if they number two or three.

Open the Treasure Chest to gain the Cloth (skip this Chest if you do not
want to risk a Mage battle for this obsolete and utterly cheap armor),
followed by going around the holes to the Treasure Chest on the left to get
a Flame Sword!  Now step into a hole to fall to the floor far below.

Your first step forward will run your character into a battle with a mix of
undead enemies as numerous as a full nine!  Use Fire and harm spells to rid
yourself of these annoyances, and then pass through the door to go down to
where a lighter grey floor leads left (that floor removes 1 Hit Point from
each character per step).  Enter the room you find to get into a fight!

~~~FROST DRAGON~~~

H.P.: 200

Gold: 1701

Exp.: 2000

A fearsome fight, you will face one or two of these behemoths, which have
very strong physical attacks and a special attack called Blizzard (something
like Ice2 or Ice3).  They are susceptible to Fire as you might imagine, so
lay at least a Fir2 into them to help defeat them before they throw a
Blizzard are two.  otherwise it is attack, attack, attack!

After finishing the above fight, grab the Ice Armor from the Treasure Chest
above, and then go left to get the Silver Gauntlet ONLY IF you want to fight
the Blizzard Dragon fight again.  Return to the main path, head down over
the damaging floor to go down the right path to then pass the two branches
to go through a narrow opening in the rock.  Take the left fork to find a
room with six treasure Chest, containing (left to right, starting with top
row): 7900 Gold Pieces, 5450 Gold Pieces, 180 Gold Pieces (you will need to
kill Frost Wolves for this one), 9900 Gold Pieces, 5000 Gold Pieces, and
12350 Gold Pieces!  Now backtrack up the path to the right fork and go down
that path to follow it to a stairway leading upwards.

Go down to the Treasure Chest below to get a Heal Potion, exit the room, and
then go enter the room below for 10000 Gold Pieces.  Now head right and then
down around the border of the room to enter the door to pass the hole to
open the three Treasure Chests (left to right): 9500 Gold Pieces, Tent, and
an Ice Shield.  Now have your party leap down the hole that you are standing
near to fall to a floor far below.  Carefully walk towards the Treasure
Chest above your party to get into a fight!

~~~EYE~~~

H.P.: 162

Gold: 3225

Exp.: 3225

A very serious opponent, the Eye is very big on one-hit kills (Rub, Stone,
XXXX).  However, with a weak defense, weapons can cut this evil entity down
quickly.  As for Magic, hard hitting magic spells are a gamble, Mute is a
great move (stop the spells, no danger from his enemy).

After defeating this enemy, open the Treasure Chest to find the FLOATER!
You can now jump down a hole to start your trek out of the cave!  Also note
that the Eye is a great place to come to when you your entire party is
equipped with ProRings, which protects against spells like Rub and XXXX, so
your Experience and Gold totals can quickly be rolled up in a short amount
of time.

To leave this Cave, you will have to duel the Undead posses again, head down
over the damaging floor and bearing right, followed by continuing down past
the two branches to go through a narrow rock space.  Take the right fork and
follow it to a staircase.  After entering and then exiting the room, go
right and then up and right around the room to find a stairway leading to
the surface!

Now that you have finished off this harsh task in an unforgiving and cold
setting, you will need to return to your ship along the river way (refer to
the path in earlier in the FAQ for details), and then set sail for the
desert you passed earlier.  Head south along the coast, turning west when
the coast does so, and you will arrive at a river just to the east of a
desert.  Land on the river mouth, hike into the desert, and use your FLOATER
to make the Airship rise magically from its hiding place in the sand!

Now you will have access to the North, which opens up a realm of
possibilities.  However, for now your only goal in the north is to find the
Dragon Islands, which are home to the Dragons, who are rumoured to reward
great feats of courage!  Fly to Matoya's Cave before heading north to find
holes in the ground of a bunch of islands, which are the homes of the
dragons.

Start off by finding the Castle Of Ordeals (it is to the east of the
islands), go southwest to find an island with forest surrounding it to enter
to find 2750 Gold Pieces, 2000 Gold Pieces, 1455 Gold Pieces, 160 Gold
Pieces, 9500 Gold Pieces, 1520 Gold Pieces, and 2750 Gold Pieces in the two
rooms with the Treasure Chests.  Take off again and fly west to land on the
marshy island and walk into the cave there to find the following goodies
from Treasure Chests: House, 500 Gold Pieces, and 10 Gold Pieces.  Now head
northwest to find a single cave with some Treasure Chests: Cabin, 575 Gold
Pieces, and a Soft Potion.  Now you should head east, landing the Airship on
southern tip of the island and enter the nearby cave to go through the long
passageways to find Bahamut, King of Dragons.  He rewards courage, and since
we already grabbed the TAIL, you have proof of courage, thus your courage
will be rewarded by your characters receiving a CLASS CHANGE!

Now you can explore the north a little bit more, the main place to head is
to Gaia.  Upon taking off, head east until you find a large desert, at which
point you should head for the northeast corner of it and continue northeast
to find Gaia in an enclosed valley (land and enter).

                                   ------
                                    Gaia
                                   ------

After touring town to learn of a kidnapped fairy, a shining object flying to
the east, and that the fairy was sold to a Caravan.  However, you do not
need to concern yourself with any of this as you are here to sample the
wares.  Note that Xfer does not work as designed against enemies (only works 
on allies), so do not purchase it.

You have the best weapon in the game for the Black Wizard (not counting an
ultimate weapon later), Gold Bracelets (amazing armor for Wizards and a
Master), and ProRings for those who can not use Gauntlets (it also protects
against Rub),  Once you have finished splurging your gains from the Castle
Of Ordeals, Ice Cave, and Dragon Islands, you should also check out the
Magic Shops to see what you should buy once you gain spell charges for those
levels.  Keep Gaia in mind as you advance through the game as you will need
to return more than a couple times to buy and to perform some good deeds.

Now you are FINALLY ready to go the Gurgu Volcano, but you may want to
drop by Crescent Lake to buy the Exit spell for your White Wizard or Red
Wizard.  Regardless, find the Gurgu Volcano (northwest of Crescent Lake,
east of Elfland), use a tent to save just outside of it, and then head into
the fiery depths below!

                              ---------------
                               Gurgu Volcano
                              ---------------

Head up and then left to pass over the lava floor (damaging floor) to then
go up the stairway located there.  The second floor is far larger, your
first step is to pass through the door and go up the hallway, past the first
left to take the second left.  Go up the passageway above, go down the left
hallway and follow it towards the Treasure Chest to fight for the good
contained within!

You will face one or two of these beings here (and every other spot they
inhabit), so try to take them down quickly.  They have a fairly strong
attack ability, but no special attacks with which to really assault your
team.  That being said, have your team attack with weapons, have your Red
Wizard or Black Wizard attack with Ice2 or Ice3, and have your White Wizard
or Red Wizard perform healing duties as needed.

Open the Treasure Chest for the Giant Sword contained within, then retrace
your steps back to the upwards passage and follow it to find a Treasure
Chest with 4150 Gold Pieces inside of it.  Now head up, then left to take
the second passage leading down to get to two Treasure Chests (guarded by a
Fire set) to get 750 Gold Pieces and 795 Gold Pieces.  Now head down along
the left wall (left from your point of view) to enter a room with a
multitude of Treasure Chests!  Walk into the room on the left square of the
three square-wide entrance (avoids a Fire fight) to open the first two
Treasure Chests to get a Silver Gauntlet and a Silver Helmet.  Next, go down
to get the Heal Potion and the Cabin from the two Treasure Chests below,
followed by moving right to get 1975 Gold Pieces and then into a fight with
a Grey Worm (weak to Ice attacks) for 1455 Gold Pieces.  Now grab the Pure
Potion from below, the 1520 Gold Pieces from above, and then go to the right
side of the Treasure Chest stack to grab 1760 Gold Pieces, Silver Shield,
Silver Axe, and a Heal Potion.  Now you are ready to leave, so head back up
the passage to take the first right to go down through a door to the outside
hallway.  Now head across the damaging floor of lava and go down the
stairway.

This floor is simple enough in design, you just need to pick your way across
the lava floor to avoid taking unneeded damage as you head right to the
stairway leading downwards.  This floor is filled with massive fields of
lava, so head down and to the right as you jump from safe spot to safe spot
to avoid damage to finally reach the stairway.  Now you will head down, take
the passage to the left, and then go down the passage in the next room.
Head left through the large chunks of lava flooring and find yourself a
stairway leading downwards.

Go left and then up through the door, cutting right to open the Treasure
Chest on the right (avoids a grey Worm fight) from below for a Soft Potion,
followed by opening the Treasure Chest on the left (avoids an Agama fight)
from the side.  Exit the room and resume heading left and then down across
the damaging lava floor to find another room to enter.  Inside is 1760 Gold
Pieces in a Treasure Chest, followed by exiting the room and following the
corridor to the left to find another room.  Open the Treasure Chest near the
door for a Pure Potion, then the Treasure Chest directly above for 7340 Gold
Pieces, and then go right and up to fight a Grey Worm (weak to Ice) to open
the Treasure Chest to the right for a Flame Shield.  Now open the remaining
two Treasure Chests (Ice Sword and 880 Gold Pieces) before leaving the room
and heading back past the room before to take the pathway down to eventually
find another room.  Open the two Treasure Chests (fighting Agamas) for 1250
Gold Pieces and a Wooden Staff (SUCH ADVANCED WEAPONRY!) before exiting the
room to head down to find the stairway leading downwards.

Now you have arrived at the final floor, so you must decide if you wish to
go after the Flame Armor or not before going to tackle the Fiend of Fire.
If you have decided to skip it, then walk down the passage leading down-left
(skipping past the fight listed below to the fight labeled "KARY").
Otherwise, walk down the passage to the left to find a room to enter.  Here
you will have to fight through a couple enemies as you go to the Treasure
Chest, fighting an Agama and then this delightful fellow.

When you run into this mean character, hope you can finish him off fast!  He
can use his special attack of Blaze (Fir3 is the equivalent) to damage each
party member for up to 300 Hit Points each, AND he can also attack with
ferocity (often inflicting 100 Hit Points or more damage).  This beast is
vulnerable to Ice, but you may have run out of charges for it by now, so use
Fir3 or Lit3 from a Black Wizard instead.  Everyone else should attack like
mad, with your Wizards working extra hard to Cure any damage taken from this
hard hitter.

Now take the Flame Armor, fight the Agama again, and then exit the room to
head downwards to find a branch going down left that leads to a room where
your party should pause as they enter to refill their Hit Points.  In case
you have not learned, the this is a fiery place and that ball contains THE
FIEND OF FIRE!

Kary has a decent attack power and the ability to throw multiple hits at her
targets.  That being said, her true power lies in her use of Fir2 and her
ability to stun your party members.  This fight will require a few simple
steps to assure your victory, which are: Knight and Master attack, Red
Wizard, Ninja, and Black Wizard use Fast on the proficient weaponry users
(even themselves if necessary), and White Wizard will use Inv2 and then Cure
any ailing allies.  Your Black Wizard can switch to attack spells if he so
desires, but they have minimal effect most of the time.

After defeating the fiend, step forward to touch the altar that he was
protecting, which will cause an ORB to shine!  Now continue forward to use
the warp there to return to the outside world!  Jump on your Airship and
head to any town you wish to stay at the Inn, sell your excess Armor and
Weapons, and then restock your supplies (I suggest Coneria for the cheap
Inn).

With all of your newfound money, Gaia may be a good place to stop and shop
at before you do anything (pick up anything you have yet to buy).  Then you
should head off to Onrac to see if you can track down where the Fairy ended
up.  Find the Dragon Islands and fly west to pass near Onrac (if you see a
Waterfall in a river, head south to find Onrac).  Look for a landing spot
to the southwest for your Airship (grass and plains landings only!),
followed by hiking northeast across a river as you approach Onrac.

If you have any money left over from splurging around the world, here are
the local wares to whet your appetite (avoid the Sabr spell as it does not
work due to buggy programming):

Now that is done with, wander through town to learn many interesting things,
including: a flying, shining object (sound familiar?) seen by Kope, Kope
himself saying it is near the Waterfall to the north, the caravan owner has
a mysterious object (mentioned in Gaia about the fairy being sold to a
caravan), the oasis is shop for the caravan (located to the west in the
desert), and that Dr. Unne (he is in Melmond) can speak Lefienish IF he ever
had the SLAB that sunk in the Sea Shrine.  WOW!  Despite this information
overload, you are now ready to start your work to get into the Sea Shrine.

The first step we will go through with is not really required right now, but
it yields a fabulous amount of booty, INCLUDING an amazingly powerful sword
for your Knight, Ninja, or Red Wizard.  Head west to find the river near
Onrac, start paddling north, and when you arrive at the Waterfall, set up a
Tent/Cabin/House to save your game if you like before entering the Waterfall
(I have NO IDEA how you can do so in a Canoe, yet here we are).

                                 -----------
                                  Waterfall
                                 -----------

This place can be highly dangerous, with a few of the rough players in here
being Mud Gols and Gas Dragons (they are lethal).  However, a good dose of
running and luck will see you through.

Start off by walking upwards to find a fork in the path, which is where you
will go left and then up.  After arriving at the next fork, head left to
find another fork, where your party will continue along the up-left path.
When the party finds a fork, head down to quickly find another fork that
should be followed to the left to where the path turns right to find a room.

Upon entering, you will be attacked by a random setting of the following
monsters (Mummy, WzMummy, Cocktrice, Perilisk), so use Fir2/Fir3 or
Hrm2/Hrm3 (for the undead Mummies/WzMummies) along with hit all Weapon/Armor
(like the Zeus Gauntlet) and physical hits on the WzMummies to win.  Now
step forward to raid the Treasure Chest (left to right) for: Wizard Staff
(casts Conf in battle as an Item), Ribbon (amazing protection against
element attacks as well as deadly attacks like Rub), 13450 Gold Pieces, 6400
Gold Pieces, 5000 Gold Pieces, and the Defense Sword!  Now you need to talk
to the robot (the shining object falling from the sky!) to receive the CUBE,
which is a key to reach the FLOATING CASTLE (mentioned numerous times by now
through townsfolk).

Now you are faced with a couple choices on where to go next, you can either:
fight your way back to the entrance OR just use your Exit magic (provided
you have it) to get out.  Head south down the river, cutting east across
land into Onrac to refill your Hit points/Spell Charges at the Inn if you
like.  Once you are ready, get into your Airship (to the southwest of Onrac)
to go to the oasis to see the Caravan wares.

Head north to find a small desert (which is west of Onrac as stated earlier)
to find a small patch of trees and grass (the Oasis).  Now, landing in the
desert is not allowed as we know, BUT you can land your Airship on the patch
of desert in the middle of the grass outline which is the Oasis!  Just land
right on it, step off of the spot and then step back to enter the Caravan to
find that a Bottle is for sale at 50000 Gold Pieces (totally worth the price
of the Item I assure you).  Now that you have purchased it, it is time to
get back onto your Airship and take to the skies to fly west until you find
a lake surrounded by forest, which is where you will turn north to fly to
the enclosed town of Gaia.

                                   ------
                                    Gaia
                                   ------

Once you enter the town, select the Bottle and a Fairy will pop out and fly
away (you can do this before you arrive as well)!  Now head up to the
previously empty Fairy pond to find out that she is so appreciative that she
will draw the OXYALE from the spring, which will allow your party to be able
to use the submarine to reach the submerged Sea Shrine!  Head back to Onrac
(use your B Button + SELECT map if need be to find it), go into Onrac, buy
any supplies that you may need, and then go enter the Submarine to appear
underneath the waves.

                                ------------
                                 Sea Shrine
                                ------------

Two trips are recommended for this dungeon, so the first one will be covered
here.

Go up through the columns, cutting right through the same columns to find a
room with a Treasure Chest containing 2000 Gold Pieces.  Now exit and go
right and then up to pass the next two hallways on the left to take the
third one to the left to take the stairway leading upwards.

Walk down to the first fork (ignoring the room above) to go left and then up
around the room to find a door inside to get a mind boggling 20 GOLD PIECES!
Exit the room and head up and left to find a windy path leading to a room
with Opal Armor, followed by backtracking down the path top take the left
path down to find a room with a Light Axe inside (casts Hrm2 when used as an
Item).  Go right and then up to find a Mage Staff in a Treasure Chest room
(casts Fir2 when used as an Item), then head right and down to pass the
stairway as you enter the nearby room to get 12350 Gold Pieces.  Now you may
take the stairway leading upwards.

You will arrive on the floor that the mermaids have been trapped on by the
monsters!  Talk to the mermaids as you collect the following treasure from
the various rooms: 9000 Gold Pieces, 1760 Gold Pieces, Opal Bracelet, 2750
Gold Pieces, 4150 Gold Pieces, Pure Potion, Opal Shield, 5000 Gold Pieces,
10000 Gold Pieces, and 10 Gold Pieces.  Now you may have noticed one room
you can not reach conventionally, so you will need to bend the laws of
common sense and physics (I love video games that do that!) by heading for
the top left corner of the floor to take a narrow path to walk left for a
bit until the game wraps around and you arrive at the blocked off room!
Enter it to find three Treasure Chests containing: Opal Helmet, Opal
Gauntlet, and the SLAB!  Now you have reached the end of your first trip
into the Sea Shrine so backtrack to the submarine OR use an Exit spell if
you have it to return to Onrac!

                                   -------
                                    Onrac
                                   -------

You may wish to leave Onrac and sell your excess Weapons and Armor pieces
before venturing into the watery depths again, so Gaia is a good choice due
to it's nearby positioning.  Once you are ready to tackle the Sea Shrine
again, stay at the Inn to save and refill your Hit Points and spell charges,
and then board the submarine once again!

                                ------------
                                 Sea Shrine
                                ------------

Now you will begin your second trip into the Sea Shrine.

Go up through the columns, cutting left through the same columns, and then
go up at the turn in the hallway to find a room with a Treasure Chest
containing 9900 Gold Pieces.  Head right upon exiting the room, go along the
hallway to the right and then up, going to the top left corner of the floor
to descend to the next floor via the stairway.

Head left and take the path leading upwards and continue following the
upward path at the next two forks to go straight up past a room to take the
stairs leading downwards.  This is a no brainer, but just in case you have
troubles, here are the steps:  go right two, up two OR go up two, right two
OR go up one, right one, up one, right one OR go up one, right two, up one
OR go right one, up two, right one.  You will then arrive at the floor above
in a different section than before.  Of course, this floor is massively
short, so just walk past the room to the opposite corner of the floor to
find the stairway leading downwards.

Enter the room, grab the 110 Gold Pieces from the first Treasure Chest, and
then go down, collecting the Treasure Chest (450 Gold Pieces) as you go
through the door and down the stairway to the next floor below.

Go left to the first fork, head down and then right to enter a room to find
two Treasure Chests containing: 8135 Gold Pieces and 7690 Gold Pieces (make
sure to open them from underneath or face Water OR Wz Sahag and R. Sahag in
battle).  Now head left along the bottom wall of the path to find a room
with three Treasure Chests containing: 5450 Gold Pieces, 385 Gold Pieces,
and a Power Gauntlet (you will need to fight a Mummy, WzMummy, Perilisk, and
Coctrice combo OR two Waters to get this one).  Exit the room to head right
to take the path leading up at the next two forks to enter a room with a
Treasure Chest containing a Light Axe (fight either Grey Sharks and a Wz
Sahag OR Sea Trolls, Lobsters, and Sea Snakes for it), followed by leaving
the room to move right to enter a room containing four Treasure Chests: 2750
Gold Pieces, 9900 Gold Pieces, Ribbon, and 7340 Gold Pieces.  Head left and
then up to arrive at a fork, turn left to go down the stairway to the next
floor.

Head up the hallway to find a room to enter, where you should walk right and
exit the room through a door to go down and left to find a path beside a
large room.  Follow the hallway as it leads down and then cut left to find
the door to enter the room to walk up between the empty "box" room walls to
find a door to exit from.  Follow the path to find a door to enter to see a
crystal orb sitting there!  Fill up your Hit Points completely, because
inside of that ball resides, THE FIEND OF WATER!

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~KRAKEN~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

H.P.: 800

Gold: 5000

Exp.: 4245

Although Kraken is seen as an easy Fiend to destroy, he does possess some
very strong skills.  He does have on attack that is essentially a waste of a
turn (Ink, which is a Dark spell), but he can land up to 8 Hits at a time,
allowing him to deal well over 100 Hit Points of Damage!  Add into that his
strong absorb rating and you have a tough fiend to take down!  To take him
down, have your Red Wizard/Black Wizard/Ninja cast Fast on hard hitters like
Knights/Masters/Ninjas, have your White Wizard cast Inv2 (may allow your
characters to dodge an attack from Kraken), and have your attackers throw
their best shots at the fiend.  After you have Fasted everyone, start
throwing Lit2 and Lit3 spells at Kraken, and be sure to have your White
Wizard and Red Wizard ready on the Cure spells to help out their injured
comrades.

After defeating the fiend, step forward to touch the altar that he was
protecting, which will cause an ORB to shine!  Now continue forward to use
the warp there to return to the outside world!  Now you will need to find an
Inn as well as a shop to sell your excess Weapons and Armors, before
restocking your Heal Potions to ready yourself for the next step in your
journey!

   | Light Warriors OR Anthropologists!? Quest For The Crystal Of Air |
   o------------------------------------------------------------------o

Fly on over to Melmond with the SLAB in hand and talk to Dr. Unne to have
him learn Lefienish.  He will also teach your characters on how to speak it,
thus allowing you to converse with the people of Lefien (who hold important
Items and Magic!).  Now take to the air, fly northwest towards the big
desert, and then find the lake surrounded by forest.  Here you will spy one
spot of grassland that allows you to land your Airship, so do so to allow
the trek to remote Lefien to begin!

Start off by walking along the western border of the lake, turning east to
walk till the lake is left behind.  When the land narrows to the south, head
down through the marsh and forest sections to find the enclosed village.

                                  --------
                                   Lefien
                                  --------

Since you have translated the SLAB, courtesy of Dr. Unne, you can understand
the inhabitants (if you can not, then you need to visit Dr. Unne in
Melmond).  Wander the town and talk to learn many fascinating things,
including: the Sky Warriors were from here (you have their Airship now), the
Floating Castle and the Robots were made by them (knowledge is now lost),
the Mirage Tower is the entrance to the Floating Castle, and that Tiamat
controls the Floating Castle.  When you are in the bottom right area of the
town, talk to the fellow standing still near the water to receive the CHIME,
which grants entrance to the Mirage Tower!

Now that you have done your usual investigating, it is time to sample what
little these people offer to sell you:

Now you are ready to leave, so head north, turning northwest when you find
the lake again.  Take off in your Airship, fly north to Gaia if you wish to
do some shopping/selling/Inn staying, and then fly south to enter the
desert.  Locate the Mirage Tower (close to northeast corner of the desert),
fly east to the mountains, and then follow the mountains south to find a
small patch of grass that is large enough for your Airship to land on.  Get
off and start hoofing to the northwest to find and enter the Mirage Tower!

                               --------------
                                Mirage Tower
                               --------------

Walk straight up through the door and continue until you meet a grey divider
wall.  GO right and then up as you follow the wall you bumped into to find a
hole in the all that you should go down through.  Head right to find 880
Gold Pieces in a Treasure Chest, then go down to liberate a Heal Helmet
(casts Heal as an Item in battle), and then enter the small cubby hole on
the left to find three Treasure Chests containing: 3400 Gold Pieces, 18010
Gold Pieces, and the Vorpal Sword.  Now head down, left, and then up the
first hallway to go right to find two Treasure Chests (Aegis Shield and 2750
Gold Pieces), followed by going back down and then left to enter the next
hallway leading upwards to find another Treasure Chest (Cabin).  Now have
your party go up to turn left and then down to find the two doors, taking
the one on the left to go up the stairway.

When you appear, you will see a wall of columns right above your party.
Using this wall as a reference point, follow it as it slowly circles the room
until you arrive at a small hole.  Here you will go right through the hole,
go up and then right through the next hole, and then start walking down.
Follow the perimeter of the room down and then right to find a door, which
allows access to the treasure room.  In the ten treasure Chests (going up
the left side and then down the right side) you will find : 8135 Gold
Pieces, 7900 Gold Pieces, Thor Hammer (casts Lit2 an an Item in battle),
12350 Gold Pieces, 13000 Gold Pieces, House, 7690 Gold Pieces, Sun Sword,
10000 Gold Pieces, and Dragon Armor.

Now that you have raided all of the Treasure in the Mirage Tower, you should
use an Exit spell or go out the way you came, head southeast to get onto the
Airship, and then fly north to Gaia to sell your excess Armor and Weapons.
This is done due to the trove of treasure waiting in the Floating Castle,
and have I ever steered you wrong (well not badly anyway).  Once you are all
set (you may want to do an Inn visit), get onto the Airship, go back to your
small landing area southeast of the Mirage Tower, and then re-enter the
Mirage Tower.

Go up through the door, go left, and then go down through the door to go up
the stairs to the next floor.  When you appear, you will see a wall of
columns directly above your party.  Using this wall as a reference point,
follow it as it slowly circles the room until you arrive at a small hole.
Here you will go right through the hole, go up and then right through the
next hole, and then go right to go up the stairway to the next floor.  Now
you will walk downwards around the perimeter of the room to find a doorway,
and when you enter, a fight will ensue!

~~~BLUE DRAGON~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HP: 454

Gold: 2000

Exp: 3274

This is a big, bad, and mad dragon that can hit hard and has a hit all
attack called Thunder!  However, his defense is not top notch, so you can
land some very damaging physical attacks with Knights, Masters, and Ninjas.
The Blue Dragon also has an elemental weakness to Fire, so a Red
Wizard/Black Wizard Fir3 would be ideal as well for dealing large amounts of
damage.  If you have a White Wizard, they will have to be on healing duty,
possibly using the Mage Staff in battle for a shot of Fir2 to help out.

Once you have finished this battle, step forward to go into the portal
ahead, using your CUBE to activate it, and you will be whisked away to the
Floating Castle!

                              -----------------
                               Floating Castle
                              -----------------

Remember that Exit will get you out of here at any time, whether you need to
sell some equipment (making room for more stuff) or you want to run a certain
Item to the Dwarves to obtain the second most powerful sword in the game
(Knight only sword though).

Walk straight down to go down around the perimeter of the room to find a
door which you will enter and open the Treasure Chest to get the Bane Sword
(casts Bane when used as an Item in battle).  Return to the central
platform, this time going to the right to find a room (door at the bottom of
the room) to find five Treasure Chests containing: 180 Gold Pieces, Heal
Helmet (casts Heal when used as an item in battle), 6720 Gold Pieces,
ProRing, and 5000 Gold Pieces.  Return to the central chamber, going on to
the left branch to find a room with four Treasure Chests containing: 7900
Gold Pieces, 4150 Gold Pieces, Heal Potion, and 9900 Gold Pieces.  Now you
have to return to the central area, taking the path upwards (the only one
you have not traversed yet) to find a transporter leading to the next floor.

Head down through the narrow hallway to the central area, turning left to go
up-left to a room that has a House and a Silver Helmet, followed by going
back to the central area to go to the up-right path to a room containing an
Opal Gauntlet.  Once you have returned to the central area, go down to the
next hall to go right to a room containing an Opal Shield and a Ribbon,
followed by returning to the central area to go down to take the down-right
hallway to find a room containing a Black Shirt (casts Ice2 when used as an
Item in battle) and a White Shirt (casts Inv2 when used as an Item in
battle).  Now you will need to return to the central area, go left past the
first hallway to take the next one down-left to find a room containing
ADAMANT (take this to the Dwarf Cave's blacksmith and he shall craft the
XCalibur!), followed by going back to the central area, walking upwards to
take the left passage to find a room containing 880 Gold Pieces and 13000
Gold Pieces.  Now you will return to the central chamber, head down and take
the path leading straight down to find a transporter leading to the next
floor.

Note that you can look out the window for a neat clue of where you may have
to go next.  Go straight up to find a room with four Treasure Chests
containing: Heal Potion, 5450 Gold Pieces, ProRing, and 9000 Gold Pieces
before returning to the transporter area.  This time you should head down
and to the right to find a narrow and winding path leading up to a room
where six Treasure Chests hold (up the left side, down the right side):
ProCape, Cloth, 6400 Gold Pieces, Soft Potion, 9500 Gold Pieces, and 8135
Gold Pieces before returning to the transporter area.  Take off to the left,
going past the path below to pass the hall leading left to see four Treasure
Chests containing (left to right): Soft Potion, 4150 Gold Pieces, 3400 Gold
Pieces, and Katana.  Now you will backtrack to that path leading down that
you ignored and take it to find a transport leading to the next floor.

This floor is an endless maze UNLESS you move through it using the proper
directions.  It can be solved through the use of the following ASCII map 
(graciously donated by Kyle Chapman):

   A    B    C    D
  | |  | |  | |  | | 
 -+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +-
1                    1

This means that any set of LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN combinations can be used, but 
they will all pass through the rules and layouts of the map above.  If done 
correctly, that transporter will take you to the next floor.

Welcome to the final floor!  However, you are never safe on this causeway as
a being more powerful than even the Four Fiends prowls here!  It's name is
Warmech, a deadly creation of an age long past, who sports 1000 Hit Points
as well as some serious attacking ability and even worse firepower!  Take
quick strides across the narrow bridge as you progress, and hope that your
number is not called in the 1-64 chance of meeting this monstrosity!  If you
would like to learn more specifics to fighting WarMech, please refer to the
Bosses section located directly below the walkthrough.  Anyway, walk
straight upwards (mainly cause it is the only way to go anyway), enter the
room, and heal yourself completely before stepping forward to fight the
Fiend of Air, TIAMAT!

Tiamat is by definition the hardest of the Four Fiends, as he is the last
one you will face.  He does boast  a moderately powerful Damage stat (able
to land numerous hits as well), and he does make use of Thunder, Blizzard,
and Poison as a hit-all attack.  That being said, he does hold a very glaring
weakness to Bane, so if your Red Wizard/Black Wizard can cast it, they might
try it (someone using the Bane Sword can make an extra attempt with the spell
if they can not cast it regularly).  If you do not want to trust the
fickleness of a one-hit kill spell, the conventional tactics of: Knight and
Master attack, Ninja/Red Wizard/Black Wizard cast Fast on first round, attack
on the second (you may want to use Nuke if possible), and your White Wizard
is on Cure detail as well as some Alit, Aice and/or Inv2.

After defeating the fiend, step forward to touch the altar that he was
protecting, which will cause an ORB to shine!  Now continue forward to use
the warp there to return to the outside world!  After visiting an Inn,
selling unneeded equipment, and buying all the supplies you can carry, it is
time to finally end the threats that assail the world!


                    o---------------------------------o
                    | Step Forward To Go Backwards... |
                    o---------------------------------o

If you wish to enhance your story end of things, go to Crescent Lake and
speak to the circle of sages to learn all about who is behind the Fiends,
how they are able to continue to hurt the world, and how to break this
vicious cycle.  Once you are prepared, take fight and head for the Temple
of Fiends!

                             ------------------
                              Temple Of Fiends
                             ------------------

When you arrive, head straight towards the room ahead (the same one that
pathetic Garland holed up in) to find the same five bats roaming the room as
before around the Dark Crystal.  If you want to have some more story time
fun, speak to the bats here for a pleasant surprise.  Step forward and
examine the Dark Crystal to place your four ORBS over it, causing the Time
gate to activate.  Now you take one step forward to transport your party
millions of steps backwards, 2000 years into the past!

                       -------------------------------
                        Temple Of Fiends... Revisited
                       -------------------------------

Just a quick note for the intrepid exploring party that is in the ancient
past... YOU HAVE NO CONVENTIONAL WAY TO RETURN TO THE PRESENT!  You will be
stuck in this place, so fight to the end.  However, if you have Exit, you
can leave anytime (which is why a Red Wizard or White Wizard is very useful
to have).  Warp from a Red Wizard or Black Wizard will also work, but you
will need to be on the top floor of the Temple to do so (the one you entered
on).

Please note that at this point, running from most battle is advisable to
save your Hit Points and spell charges for the battles you will need to
fight.  Head down through the door below to keep going until you reach the
blocked path (it would go outside if open), which is where you will turn
right to go along the lower wall to find a stairway that leads up to the
next floor.  Run straight across the floor here to reach a stairway leading
upwards.

On this floor, head down to get on the left side of the pillars, where you
will walk downwards past the outline of two rooms to turn right (just below
that second room frame).  When the pillar path leads upwards to a room,
follow it to see two treasure Chests in the corners, but you must first
fight a guardian!

This undead menace hits hard, uses nasty spells like Rub, XXXX, and Stone,
and has a fairly decent set of Hit Points (360 of them).  That being said,
you will be able to really lay into this guy because of his double
weaknesses (Fire and Harm), so use Fir3, Hrm2, Hrm3, Hrm4, and even Light
Axes (Hrm2) and Mage Staff (Fir2) as Items.  Have your Knight or Master
throw a physical attack in, possibly ending the fight in one blow as well.
Enjoy your 1 Experience Point and 1 Gold Piece!

If you need the money (not likely at this point, open the two Treasure
Chests in this room for some serious money (45000 Gold Pieces and 65000 Gold
Pieces) before going to see a Stone Plate in your way!  The ROD will not
work this time, but what item have you been carrying for the longest time
and as of yet have not used?  Why yes, the LUTE is indeed the key to
bypassing this obstacle and continuing onwards to find the root of the evil!
Please note that if you never got the LUTE, you need to go get it before you
can pass this point.

Head down through the door below, walk down through the pillars, turn left,
and then turn upwards when the solid wall to your left appears.  You will
find a stairway in the northwest corner of the floor leading downwards.
Head through the hallway to the left, following it to the northwest corner
of the floor to find the stairway leading downwards.

You have arrived on the Earth Floor, where you will face large groups of
enemies from the Earth Cave as well as some others thrown in for good
measure.  Start off by hoofing it upwards, turning right when the room to
your right stops extending upwards.  Ignore the pillar path leading
downwards as you take the next path downwards until a path leading down and
to the right is there for you to pass through, at which point you will be
attacked by the stairway!

Lich returns, this time sporting a few new tricks instead of his Ice2
and Slep spells, which are the deadly Nuke (100-400 Hit Points removed from
all party members), XXXX, Stop, and Zap!!  However, attack with your
Knight/Master/Ninja, and use Harm and Fire spells with your Wizards to
quickly put this Fiend back to sleep.

Now you will be on the Fire Floor, so expect lots of scorching reminders of
the Gurgu Volcano as well as some other unpleasant fellows.  Head left to
find pillars, which is where you should go up to enter a door.  Head right,
going straight till you can go downwards to pass out the door below,
followed by walking down to get between the pillars.  if you want to go
straight to fighting Kary, go to the next paragraph.  If you want to go on a
small detour for the Katana, follow this paragraph (only useful if you have
two or more Ninjas).  Walk left but go through the small opening below
instead of going up to the stairway (Kary waits there), and then go through
the door on the right to get a ProCape, go down and right to find a remote
room with 26000 Gold Pieces, and then return to the original door to take
the left door to get a ProRing and down through the next door to follow a
path a really remote room where the Katana lies waiting.  Now return to the
stairway leading downwards to fight Kary.

Kary has a decent attack power and the ability to throw multiple hits at her
targets.  That being said, her true power lies in her use of Fir2, Rub, and 
her ability to stun your party members.  This fight will require a few simple
steps to assure your victory, which are: Knight and Master attack, Red
Wizard, Ninja, and Black Wizard use Fast on the proficient weaponry users
(if you feel it necessary), and White Wizard will use Inv2 and then Cure
any ailing allies.  Your Black Wizard can switch to attack spells if he so
desires, but they have minimal effect most of the time.


The following floor is the Water Floor, so expect to meet many Sea Shrine
buddies as well as a few other water buddies from the ocean/river areas.
Go through the room to the right, walk right past the first room to cut down
through the pillars to enter the door on the right to follow the winding
hallway to a door.  Head up through the next door, turning left to go down
through the first door you encounter.  Continue downwards, turn right and
walk to find Kraken!

Although Kraken is seen as an easy Fiend to destroy, he does possess some
very strong skills.  He does have on attack that is essentially a waste of a
turn (Ink, which is a Dark spell), but he can land up to 8 Hits at a time,
allowing him to deal well over 100 Hit Points of Damage!  Add into that his
strong absorb rating and you have a tough fiend to take down!  Also note that
he has added Lit2 to his arsenal of attacks (somehow, since this is supposed
to be a PAST form of the evil).  To take him down, have your Red Wizard/Black
Wizard/Ninja cast Fast on hard hitters like Knights/Masters/Ninjas (maybe use
one charge from each), have your White Wizard cast Inv2 (may allow your 
characters to dodge an attack from Kraken), and have your attackers throw 
their best shots at the fiend.  Start throwing attack spells at Kraken, and 
be sure to have your White Wizard and Red Wizard ready on the Cure spells to 
help out their injured comrades.


Continue to the stairs to go to the next floor.

This is the Air Floor, where you will face residents of the Mirage Tower,
Floating Castle, and a few really nasty fellows.  Head down, then right,
then down, and then go down-right to find a narrow hallway going diagonally.
Follow it to the very end to enter a room where a Treasure Chest holds the
strongest weapon in the game, the Masamune (equippable by anyone!).  Now
backtrack up the diagonal path, go left to backtrack to the second down path
you took, and then go right to fight Tiamat!

Tiamat does boast  a moderately powerful Damage stat (able to land numerous
hits as well), he uses Bane, and he does make use of Thunder, Blizzard, and
Poison as a hit-all attack.  He also no longer holds that very glaring
weakness to Bane, so do not waste your Red Wizard/Black Wizard spellcasts on 
it.  Instead, make us of the conventional tactics of: Knight and Master 
attack, Ninja/Red Wizard/Black Wizard cast Fast on first round, attack on the
second (you may want to use Nuke if possible), and your White Wizard is on 
Cure detail as well as some Alit, Aice and/or Inv2.

Now you need to head up and to the right to find the stairway to the final
area of the game!

Here no enemies await except the final one, so go to the door to the room,
COMPLETELY fill your Hit Points, and if you think you have enough spell
charges (and guts), go through the door to find... GARLAND!?  Talk to him to
learn his tale, but he will know better this time than to fight, so he will
call upon Chaos, the almighty evil to do battle with the Light Warriors!

~~~CHAOS~~~

Chaos has a fairly powerful attack coupled with multiple hits, but his true
power lies in his mastery of magic.  He can use Fir3, Ice3, Lit3, Tornado,
Inferno, and Swirl for hit-all attacks as well as Crack (a one hit kill
hit-all spell).  He also has the absolutely dirty maneuver of casting Cur4
from the start of round 4 of the battle (with the recharge time on this being
at least 8 more rounds), refilling himself to 2000 Hit Points!  You will have
to be coming damn hard to beat him, so use the following ideas for each class.

Knight      : He attacks and keeps attacking till his arm falls off.

Master      : Keeps his fists of fury flying till he too can fight no more.

Ninja       : Uses Fast to help get the good attackers throwing extra shots,
              then attacks as well.

Red Wizard  : Have him use Fast, then attack once he is Fasted.  Also a
              part-time Cure/Heal user.

Black Wizard: Casts Fast, then reverts to using Nuke and other attack
              spells.

White Wizard: You may want to use Wall with her to protect some teammates,
              then she becomes a full-time Cure/Heal user.  She may also 
              wish to make use of the Fade Spell as it deals great damage.


If Chaos beats you bad, train to raise your guys for a few levels before
returning to battle him once again.  Once you finally beat him, go enjoy the
ending as you deserve it!  CONGRATULATIONS!

Garland is the first boss of the game, and as such you would expect him to
be a pushover.  However, he is so pathetic that losing to him just should
not happen.  Regardless, here are a few quick thoughts: 1) attack with every
character (except Black Mage/Red Mage who should use Fire/Lit to weaken
him), 2) White Mages can Cure someone if Garland gets lucky enough to land a
few hits on the same person, and 3) You should not lose to this guy as he is
rather weak.

opposed to risking it on his weapon).  Spread your attacks out so the
attacks will not be wasted, and just cut them down one by one.  Also note
that White Mage or Red Mage should use Cure if they gang up on an ally (not

You will have to face any amount of these tough guys from as two of them to
as high as four of them.  They are tough, they hit for lots of Damage, and
they have one weakness that barely is a weakness.  Have your Fighter
concentrate his attacks on one individual Wizard (his Silver Sword should be
good enough to cut one down), have your Black Belt/Thief/Red mage/White Mage
concentrate on attacking another for a chance of taking it down, and if you
have a Black Mage, cast Lit2 as it can potentially wipe the entire Wizard
party out in one shot.  After one round of battle, refocus your attacks to
take out the weakened Wizards, have your White Mage/Red Mage break out the
Cure spells, and use a Lit spell from your Black Mage instead of his
laughable attack abilities.

Astos will be a different type of battle as compared to what you have fought
before, mainly because he has good Magic and he does not mind using it!  He
has Rub (one hit kills), Slow (halves your Hits total), Fast (doubles his Hits 
total), and Fir2 (hurts your entire party)!  His attack is not that strong, so
physical attacks from him are not a worry, but he does have a fairly good
Absorb rating.  Have Fighter/Black Belt/Thief/ attack all of the time, have
Red Mage/Black Mage cast Fast on the physical attackers (gets them to land
more hits for more damage), and White Mage can attack unless some Cures are
needed.  Astos should not last longer than three rounds.

These guys can hit your characters for a TON of damage, so avoiding fights
with them is recommended.  That being said, running from them is not an
option, so take them on with everything you got to end the fight quickly.
They do have one weakness, and that is to Fire, so Fir2 and Fir3 will really
damage them badly.  Otherwise, go to work with your weaponry to take them
out as soon as possible, thusly not allowing them to pound on your team too
badly.  If your allies start to look weak, use a Cur2 or Cur3 to get them
back up to snuff thanks to your White Mage/Red Mage.

Here is the terror of Melmond and he is all ready to go to battle with you!
He brings a decent attack power and his special ability called Dazzle (Stun)
to knock your party down for good!  He is undead, so of course Harm and Fire
spells will clean his clock (one shot of Fir2, Hrm2, Fir3, or Hrm3 are often
enough to knock him down immediately!)!  The rest of the party should
concentrate on attacking this monstrosity and erasing him from existence.
use a Cure spell if he badly damages one of your party members.

Lich is the first fiend so he is of course the weakest of the four.  However,
he does have a fairly good attack power (he can stun the person he attacks),
spells like Ice2 (hits your entire party) and Slep (can knock members out of
the fight for a while), and he can land multiple hits as well.  That being
said, Lich is classified as undead, so Fire and harm spells will slaughter
his Hit points (therefore he can die from one blast each of Fir3 and Hrm3).
You have two options, both of which depend on how you wish to fight the
battle.  Have your Mages go all out and cast Fire and Harm, leaving your
weapon users to remove meager amounts of Hit Points (Lich DOES have a high
Absorb rating), OR have your Red Mage and Black Mage cast Fast on the
weapon users to take him down physically (the first method is likely
preferred, but it requires you to save your spell charges as you trek
through the cave).  Not a very hard fight, but Lich can kill a party member
of yours off quickly.

You will face one or two of these guys, and they are fairly dangerous.  They

of using Fast!  They have no real weak point so attack them with your

their brutal attacking abilities.

You will have to brawl with a couple undead Dragons that have a high attack

the attacks and use a hard hitting attack spell if they number two or three.

A fearsome fight, you will face one or two of these behemoths, which have
very strong physical attacks and a special attack called Blizzard (something
like Ice2 or Ice3).  They are susceptible to Fire as you might imagine, so
lay at least a Fir2 into them to help defeat them before they throw a
Blizzard are two.  otherwise it is attack, attack, attack!

A very serious opponent, the Eye is very big on one-hit kills (Rub, Stone,
XXXX).  However, with a weak defense, weapons can cut this evil entity down
quickly.  As for Magic, hard hitting magic spells are a gamble, Mute is a
great move (stop the spells, no danger from his enemy).

You will face one or two of these beings here (and every other spot they
inhabit), so try to take them down quickly.  They have a fairly strong
attack ability, but no special attacks with which to really assault your
team.  That being said, have your team attack with weapons, have your Red
Wizard or Black Wizard attack with Ice2 or Ice3, and have your White Wizard
or Red Wizard perform healing duties as needed.

When you run into this mean character, hope you can finish him off fast!  He
can use his special attack of Blaze (Fir3 is the equivalent) to damage each
party member for up to 300 Hit Points each, AND he can also attack with
ferocity (often inflicting 100 Hit Points or more damage).  This beast is
vulnerable to Ice, but you may have run out of charges for it by now, so use
Fir3 or Lit3 from a Black Wizard instead.  Everyone else should attack like
mad, with your Wizards working extra hard to Cure any damage taken from this
hard hitter.

Kary has a decent attack power and the ability to throw multiple hits at her
targets.  That being said, her true power lies in her use of Fir2 and her
ability to stun your party members.  This fight will require a few simple
steps to assure your victory, which are: Knight and Master attack, Red
Wizard, Ninja, and Black Wizard use Fast on the proficient weaponry users
(even themselves if necessary), and White Wizard will use Inv2 and then Cure
any ailing allies.  Your Black Wizard can switch to attack spells if he so
desires, but they have minimal effect most of the time.

Although Kraken is seen as an easy Fiend to destroy, he does possess some
very strong skills.  He does have on attack that is essentially a waste of a
turn (Ink, which is a Dark spell), but he can land up to 8 Hits at a time,
allowing him to deal well over 100 Hit Points of Damage!  Add into that his
strong absorb rating and you have a tough fiend to take down!  To take him
down, have your Red Wizard/Black Wizard/Ninja cast Fast on hard hitters like
Knights/Masters/Ninjas, have your White Wizard cast Inv2 (may allow your
characters to dodge an attack from Kraken), and have your attackers throw
their best shots at the fiend.  After you have Fasted everyone, start
throwing Lit2 and Lit3 spells at Kraken, and be sure to have your White
Wizard and Red Wizard ready on the Cure spells to help out their injured
comrades.

This is a big, bad, and mad dragon that can hit hard and has a hit all
attack called Thunder!  However, his defense is not top notch, so you can
land some very damaging physical attacks with Knights, Masters, and Ninjas.
The Blue Dragon also has an elemental weakness to Fire, so a Red
Wizard/Black Wizard Fir3 would be ideal as well for dealing large amounts of
damage.  If you have a White Wizard, they will have to be on healing duty,
possibly using the Mage Staff in battle for a shot of Fir2 to help out.

This fellow truly is a vicious guy, sporting an insanely strong Damage stat
(128-256) as well as a hit-all attack in Nuclear (deals up to 400 Hit Points
of damage!).  However, you can take a few pre-cautions when you come to fight
this tough guy, mainly using Afir immediately to help lessen the damage dealt
by Nuke (try INv2 as well to possibly avoid a physical attack altogether).
For taking him down, Knights and Masters tackle him physically (Ninjas too),
Ninjas/Black Wizard/Red Wizard cast Fast on the hard hitting attackers, and
White Wizard should use high end heal/Cure spells to keep everyone in the
fight.  Do not be shocked if WarMech takes down some of your party members
(even if he takes them all down) because he hits hard, he gets a couple
rounds (at least) per fight, and he will often get first strike (often landing
a devastating Nuclear attack).

Tiamat is by definition the hardest of the Four Fiends, as he is the last
one you will face.  He does boast  a moderately powerful Damage stat (able
to land numerous hits as well), and he does make use of Thunder, Blizzard,
and Poison as a hit-all attack.  That being said, he does hold a very
glaring weakness to Bane, so if your Red Wizard/Black Wizard can cast it,
they might try it (someone using the Bane Sword can make an extra attempt
with the spell if they can not cast it regularly).  If you do not want to
trust the fickleness of a one-hit kill spell, the conventional tactics of:
Knight and Master attack, Ninja/Red Wizard/Black Wizard cast Fast on first
round, attack on the second (you may want to use Nuke if possible), and
your White Wizard is on Cure detail as well as some Alit, Aice and/or Inv2.

This undead menace hits hard, uses nasty spells like Rub, XXXX, and Stone,
and has a fairly decent set of Hit Points (360 of them).  That being said,
you will be able to really lay into this guy because of his double
weaknesses (Fire and Harm), so use Fir3, Hrm2, Hrm3, Hrm4, and even Light
Axes (Hrm2) and Mage Staff (Fir2) as Items.  Have your Knight or Master
throw a physical attack in, possibly ending the fight in one blow as well.
Enjoy your 1 Experience Point and 1 Gold Piece!

Chaos has a fairly powerful attack coupled with multiple hits, but his true
power lies in his mastery of magic.  He can use Fir3, Ice3, Lit3, Tornado,
Inferno, and Swirl for hit-all attacks as well as Crack (a one hit kill
hit-all spell).  He also has the absolutely dirty maneuver of casting Cur4
from the start of round 4 of the battle (with the recharge time on this being
at least 8 more rounds), refilling himself to 2000 Hit Points!  You will have
to be coming damn hard to beat him, so use the following ideas for each 
class.

Knight      : He attacks and keeps attacking till his arm falls off.

Master      : Keeps his fists of fury flying till he too can fight no more.

Ninja       : Uses Fast to help get the good attackers throwing extra shots,
              then attacks as well.

Red Wizard  : Have him use Fast, then attack once he is Fasted.  Also a
              part-time Cure/Heal user.

Black Wizard: Casts Fast, then reverts to using Nuke and other attack
              spells.

White Wizard: You may want to use Wall with her to protect some teammates,
              Possibly Fade to hurt Chaos, and then she becomes a full-time    
              Cure/Heal user.

8) This section will list every Weapon found within the game and list stats
   and special powers (if any).  Weapons will be listed alphabetically.

   Damage is the stat that will add to your strength (although that stat has
   a formula for base Damage) to make your attack power.  Hit% will
   determines the number of hits that can be delivered by a character
   (higher Hit% weaponry allow for more hits, hence more damage will be
    delivered).

   One final note is that any of the weapons that have Special abilities 
   that make them more effective versus certain types of enemies (ie Coral
   Sword, Dragon Sword, Flame Sword, Giant Sword, Ice Sword, Rune Sword, 
   Sun Sword, and Were Sword) do not do so due to buggy programming.  They
   are listed with their intent in case you are playing a patched ROM that
   fixes these errors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9) This section will list every Armor found within the game and list stats
   and special powers (if any). Armors will be listed alphabetically.

   Absorb is the number that is matched against the Damage dealt from a foe,
   thereby giving the total amount of Hit Points lost.  Note that more
   Absorb than Damage dealt will result in a  1 Hit Point loss.  Evade% on a
   piece of Armor indicates the DROP in the character's Evade% and not a
   bonus.
