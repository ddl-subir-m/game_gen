These words in rather strange english greet you once you start playing Bubble 
Bobble, which is a cool oldscool 8bit game on the Sega Master System.
The game was released on several other Gaming Consoles but this FAQ deals 
exactly with the SMS Version of the game. There are not that many differences 
anyways.
So, welcome to the FAQ. This FAQ was written as part of a FAQ Completion 
Project that started on the GameFAQs contributor boards and aims to write a 
complete FAQ for every Sega Master System game in the GameFAQs database. If you 
want to help out our just want to know more just visit the following website 
with the always current link the the projecttopic and other interesting facts, 
stats and stuff:

There are not that many choices to make. 
After you have seen the start screen with the Bubble Bobble logo you enter the 
main menu. There you can chose to either start a new game with 1 or two players 
or continue where you just died.
Or you can input a password of a high level you noted down to continue from 
there, this is all quite self explaining. At least I hope so. Button 2 enters a 
letter and button 1 steps back one letter in case you entered the wrong letter 
for the password.





  () Gameplay and Controls                                                [4.0]

You are one of the two dragons Bub and Bob (depending on the number of players 
and which controller you are on. Player one is always Bub) and steer them 
through the 200 levels of Bubble Bobble on the SMS.
There are platforms in each level and you jump with the Button 2 and can change 
your position by jumping or by walking around on the platform you are on and 
dropping down to a platform below. Don't worry, you cannot die by dropping too 
deep. Actually you can jump through the bottom opening and respawn at the top 
of 
the level in some levels. You can steer your jump and destination a bit in 
midair, but not all that much, keep that in mind when jumping down and there 
are enemies down there. Which brings us to the next part...

While you are on your journey you meet some enemies. You have to trap them 
inside your Bubbles and then jump against the bubble while the enemie is 
trapped inside to get rid of the enemy and make some delicious items appear. 
You shoot the bubbles with Button 1. 

You can't jump on the heads of the enemies like in other jump run games, you 
have to trap them inside the bubbles and then pop them open. Make sure to hit 
the bubbles with your horn or your fins. That's the whole game. Of course there 
are lots of levels with different layouts. 
If you touch an enemy or rather an enemy touches you, you lose a life. You 
start 
with 3 lifes. The lifes you have left are shown in the lower corner of your 
side of the screen indicated by the green squares.


------- # Extra Scoring

 If you pop 2 bubbles with enemies inside at once you score 2.000 Points
  For popping 3 bubbles at once you score 4.000 Points
   For 4 bubbles you score 8.000 Points.
    For 5 bubbles you score 16.000 Points.
     For 6 bobbles you score 32.000 Points.
      And finally for 7 bubbles you score a fantastic 64.000 Points.


------- # Extra Lives

You can get an extra life either by completing the word EXTEND with the letter 
bubbles. See the paragraph just below for more info.
Or you get a life for a specific amount of points, that are:

30.000, 100.000, 200.000, 400.000 and 1.000.000 Points.

From 1.000.000 Points on you don't get extra lifes any more


------- # Bonus Bubbles (EXTEND)

Starting in level 4 there are bonus bubbles with letters on them coming from 
the bottom opening in a level. If you pop one of these the letter gets added to 
your side of the screen. They spell out the word EXTEND so try to finish this 
word up to get an extra live.
You can make these bubbles appear. For every 3 and more enemies you pop at once
the extend bubbles will appear from the top in the next round IF the next round
has an opening to the top.

Here is the list of bubbles and enemies you have to pop at once:

Pop 1 or 2 Enemies      0 bubbles
    3 enemies           1 bubble
    4 enemies           2 bubbles
    5 enemies           3 bubbles
    6 enemies           4 bubbles
    7 enemies           5 bubbles

Collecting a blue pearl necklace also grants you a random amount of letter 
bubbles in the next level with an opening on top. The multiple enemies popped 
at once add to this.


------- # Special Items / Power Ups

      _Orange Laboratory Flask

Sometimes an orange laboratory flask will appear. GRAB THIS. This triggers a 
bonus game.
You have to collect dots against the time (or against the other player in 2 
Player mode) and get 500 Points for every dot you collected and there is plenty 
of time.

      _Blue Laboratory Flask

This triggers the same minigame as the orange flask but you have to collect 
flowers. Each flower is also worth 500 points

      _Green Laboratory Flask

This triggers the same minigame as the orange flask but you have to collect 4 
leaf clovers. Each clover is also worth 500 points

      _Rainbow Laboratory Flask

This triggers the same minigame as the orange flask but you have to collect 
rainbows. Each rainbow is also worth 500 points


      _Red Shoe
        
Gives you 100 Points and your Dino walks faster through the level


       _Green Ramen Noodles

I'm not sure this is supposed to be ramen, but it is something green in a brown 
kind of cup. And when you pick this power up up you have machingun bubbles, 
which is pretty nice to have.


      _Blue Bust

Collect it and you can shoot flash bubbles. You will find it in level 80 for 
sure and maybe somewhere else too.


      _Necklace

Once you touch it the necklace turns into a star that bounces around the level 
in 45Â° angles and kills everything it touches.


      _Blue Book

A blue swirl will start from the middle of the level and slowly work its way to 
the outer rim of the level. Every enemy it touches is turned to ice. You don't
even have to collect the enemy now, but every frozen enemy you collect gives 
you 10000 points.


      _Blue Chalice

Stars fly all over the level and kill every enemy they touch. Looking nice and 
helping a lot, but you get no bonus for it.


      _Blue Cross
        
Fills the whole screen with some blue stuff and kills all enemies and turns 
them even into items (diamonds) that give you 700P each.

      _Yellow Cross
        
A giant flash crosses the screen from top right to bottom left until all 
enemies are dead. Of course they just continue on their path but once they 
touch the flash the die. Your dino is immune to the flash.


      _Knive
        
It's raining fruit. Hallelujah! And these fruits kill all the enemies and 
transform into diamonds. Great.


       _Flashing Heart

The red and yellow flashing heart with the symbol (of another dragon?) in the 
middle of the level freezes all enemies so that they don't move around anymore 
and you just have to bubble and pop them. Or just touch them, that also works.
And you are faster as if you collected the red shoe. And you should be fast 
enough to turn all enemies into precious diamonds as the effect last quite long 
but not forever.


      _Blue Umbrella

The blue umbrella lets you skip 3 levels.

      _Yellow Umbrella

The blue umbrella lets you skip 3 levels.

      _Red Umbrella

The red umbrella lets you skip 5 levels.


      _Blue Leaf

Pick up the blue leaf and a pixe appears around your dino and circles around 
him. Every enemy the pixie touches is killed immediately. This lasts for 3 
stages and won't kill Baron von Blubba.
I found it the first time in level 135...



------- # Special Bubbles

      _Blue Bubbles

  Pop open a blue bubble and the blue mass will pour out and run through the   
  level and grab everything it touches, be it enemies or your dino.
  You can jump out of the flow every time and so use this power up to reach
  hard to reach places and kill a lot of enemies at once.
  
        
      _Flash Bubbles

  Jump agains a green flash bubble and the flash will go horizontally across 
  the level and kill everything it touches on its way. Most of the time the 
  flashes only travel to the left which can be against what you want in some
  levels.

        
      _Flame Bubbles

  Open one of these bubbles and a single flame will fall out and drop down. But 
  once this single flame reaches solid ground it unleashes its true power.
  A sea of flames unfolds over a large area of this ground and kills every 
  enemy the flames touch. If you touch the flames you don't die but you are 
  stunned for quite a long time so watch out as this could be dangerous agains
  certain enemies.
  


------- # Angry Enemies

If you stay for too long in one level the enemies get angry that you haven't 
killed them yet and turn red. The are now faster and attacking you a bit more 
aggressive. You better finish this level before the next thing happens.


------- # Hurry up

After you've seen an enemy turn red and become angry some more time can pass 
but sooner or later the sign 'Hurry Up' will appear. The music gets faster and 
the enemies also get a speedboost again.
Then again after some time Baron von Blubba, that looks like a white Monsta 
will appear. He will move slow but with big moves when he moves. Baron von 
Blubba can not be killed or be trapped in bubbles. And if he touches you, you 
lose a life.
If you manage to bubble all enemies before Baron von Blubba touches you the 
level is done. If you get killed by an enemy Baron von Blubba disappears too 
and the music is back to normal. But Baron von Blubba can reappear if you are 
playing too slow again.
Once you've seen Baron von Blubba you only get bad Items that are not worth a 
lot of points in the next level. But after you play good again all the normal 
good items will reappear.


------- # Ingame Calculations for 'random' things to happen

As you might have noticed from the quotes in the headline of this paragraph, 
all events that appear to be random in Bubble Bobble are not random at all but 
determined by some parameters that this paragraph will cover now. This will 
help you to actively get some events to appear and happen.


EVENT: Turn all bubbles on screen into candy/fruit
       when the last enemy is killed

This happens automatically on every 5th level starting with level 5 and when 
you collect the treasure chest or candy cane item.
But also happens seemingly randomly over the course of the game. But is it 
really random? No, you can make it happen on purpose.

But How? Just have the second to last and third to last digit of your score be 
the same number when you kill the last enemie. For example 324110 points 
(notice the 11) or 38660 (notice the 66) will do the trick and every bubble 
still on screen will turn into something nice for you to collect.
To get to this amount of points just burst some bubbles, this gives you 10 
points each time and you can get to a double number pretty easy.
It is even easier if you are playing with two players, so one player can set up 
his score to be a double in the second to last and third to last digit and the 
other playerer kills the last enemy.






  () THE ENEMIES                                                          [5.0]

The enemy descriptions are written by BSulpher and used with permission.


        # Zen-Chan

These are the wind-up baddies that populate many of the levels.  There only
way of attacking is to touch you.  They can jump gaps, jump through floors,
and walk around.  They first appear on stage 1.


        # Mighta 

These are very similar to Zen-Chans but they do not run around as much, and
they shoot balls of slow moving fire.  They look like little guys in white
robes.  These guys first appear on stage 6.


        # Monsta 

These are purple, flying whales that just fly around on a 90 degree angle.
They can be very annoying to get in a  bubble since they can go where ever
they please.  They first appear on stage 10.


        # PulPul 

These are floating elephant baddies who kind of move in long, sweeping motions
horizontally while barely moving vertically.  They first appear on stage 20.


        # Banebou 

These are the spring baddies.  They hop instead of walking, which can make it
exceptionally difficult to trap them at times.  They can jump over gaps, and
they can jump through floors.  They first appear on stage 30.


        # Hidegon 

These fellows throw the first fast moving projectile (fireballs), and they can
only do the jump through floors jump, not the regular jump for gaps.  They
first appear in stage 40.


        # Space Invader 

These guys can only walk, and have no jumping ability.  This make them sound
like pushovers, but they are usually strategically placed so you have to
contend with their deadly laser projectiles.  They first appear on stage 49.


        # Drunk 

These guys are the smaller version of the big boss baddie.  He moves just like
a Zen-Chan, but he also throws a wickedly fast boomeranging bottle.  This
enemy is tied with the Space Invader as the most dangerous regular baddie you
will have the misfortune of meeting.  They first appear in stage 49.


        # Baron Von Blubba 

This is the special enforcer for the Super Drunk.  He is kept in reserve on
every level to come get you if you take too long.  First you will be warned
with a very frantic sounding "HURRY UP!".  This will speed the music up, and
about ten seconds later, HIS music will hit.  Baron Von Blubba is a skeletal
Whale, and he will relentlessly follow you around while you desperately try
to kill the remaining enemies.  He will speed up his movements, and his delay
in between movements.  If playing with two players, two will appear.  The only
way to get rid of him is to destroy the enemies, or to get hit by him (at the
expense of your life reserves, so it is not the preferred method of dealing
with him).

        At first kill the 3 Zen-Chans on ground level. Then...
        Stand in the middle and shoot bubbles to the left sides so the floor 
        is filled with about 3-4 bubbles next to each other. Then jump and 
        shoot a bubble when descending again so another bubble is next to the 
        wall but above the bubble row on the floor. Then jump from a bubble 
        close to the middle to the one close to the wall and from there you 
        jump up and there you know what to do. Just have good timing with the 
        Zen-Chan's movement above. When he starts going to the left you should 
        start your move to the left too.

        Kill all Drunks on the lower part as fast as possible and don't let 
        them get trapped in bubbles and rise as they will gather up there and 
        this is bad.
        To get up shoot a bubble towards the middle and bubblejump through the 
        fat part of the levelstructure to then get off to the side before 
        touching the monsters from below. Then get up the last bit with a good 
        timed jump.
        There is a Hidegon in this room for every Mighta in the Arcade version.

        Grab one of the blue busts and you can shoot flash bubbles. Pop them 
        and hit the huge Hidegon with the flashes. Whatelse. And don't let
        the big guy and his flames touch you. As there are always some flames #
        crossing the room on ground level you better stay up on this level.
        Shooting the flash bubbles at the wall immediately releases the flash, 
        so it is quite effective to just drop down from the top on the side he 
        is currently not at.

        Even though it sounds like something your withdrawl experts might tell
        you, but you have to defeat the big drunk. He always moves in 45Â° 
        angles and so his movement can be predicted somehow. But the mean thing 
        is he throws a lot of bottles at you. Dodge them all, grab the black
        poison like icon on top and shoot the wall with your flashbubble to 
        make the flashes shoot out pretty fast and hit him 10-11 times.
        When he starts so flash in red you know you are almost done and need 
        like 1-2 more hits.
        
        After you burst his bubble the 4 normal drunks that formed the Super 
        Drunk turn to 4 6000 points diamonds and the door in the middle opens 
        up for you.
        
        
        So, you think it's over now?
        
        Wrong. Only in all other versions of Bubble Bobble the game ends at
        level 100, but not the SMS version.
        
        Read on to find out how to continue.





  () How to reach Levels 101+   (and 3 different endings)                 [7.1]
  

There are 3 different endings to the SMS version of Bubble Bobble.

------- # Bad Ending

If you just beat the Super Drunk on level 100 without having collected the 3
magic balls before you get the bad ending.
There is only text on screen telling you that you got the bad ending and you 
have to collect the 3 magic balls in level 10, 50 and 90.


------- # Normal Ending

But if you manage to collect the 3 magic balls throughout the first 100 levels 
and then you beat the Super Drunk on level 100 you will get to see the normal 
ending. There is a wedding going on, you and your second player are marrying 
your girlfriends, but again they are taken away by evil monsters, so you have 
to continue playing the set of the next 100 levels to finally see the last 
ending.

So where are these 3 hidden magic balls you need to continue playing the levels 
101-200? Okay, here they are:


        # Level 10
        
Once you cleared the level the hidden door will appear in the top right of the 
level and lead you to the red crystal ball.


        # Level 50

This door will always appear right from the start. Just get in it and you are 
taken to an important room with the blue crystall ball in it.


        # Level 90

To make the door appear you have to grab the bonus item on the top right before 
it disappears again and then the door will appear. It leads you to a room with 
the green crystall ball in it.


After you got all 3 of them magic balls and finished off the Big Drunk in level 
100 you can continue playing the next 100 levels. There are even more hidden 
doors to be found and all of them are explained in the chapter 8.0, right after 
the levellist below.


------- # Good Ending

So of course you need the 3 magic balls from levels 1-100 for this, otherwise
you are not able to enter levels higher than 100.
But to finally see the good ending you have to beat the final Boss on the last 
level, which is level 200 and collect 3 more collectibles and 1 useful item 
from hidden rooms.

And what items do you need to reach the good ending?

        # Level 115
        
This door is hard to find and reach. You have to not kill any of the Hidegons 
in the room until the Hurry Up appears. You can trap them in bubbles though.
So you can bubble jump to the first reachable higher platform and wait in 
there, the Hidegons won't touch you there. Once the Hurry Up message showed up 
you can start killing the Hidegons. The door is on the right side right there 
where there are 2 more of these hidegons running around in small space which 
makes them even more evil.

The bonus room includes only the magic key and no bonus items. But you need the
key to make all the other doors to the bonus rooms appear in the second 100 
levels and get all the other magic items for the good ending.


        # Level 135

If you have the magic key from the bonus room from level 115 this hidden door 
will be right there on levelstart but it is rather fun to reach it.
Just jump up on the left side, wait a bit until all enemies are on the other 
side, then move under the door and jump up to just touch it.

The bonus room features the red mirror. You need this item to reach the best 
ending.

        # Level 145

The magic key is not enough, to make further hidden doors appear you need the 
magic candle.
To make the door on level 145 appear you have to kill all the drunks with 
nothing but the flame bubbles. So no bubbling and popping, just burning. This 
is a fun challenge and not as hard as it sounds.
An important item than is not really neccessary for the secret doors in level 
155 and level 195, but the revealed bonus rooms might help you reach the 1k 
points for level 195...


        # Level 155

After some time into the level the blue chalice will appear. Pick it up and
a black hole opens up sucking all enemies into it. Jump into the black hole as
it actually is the gate to the blue mirror room.


        # Level 195

Close to the last level you have to get another hidden door. Here you actually 
cannot do that much within the level but you have to have 1.000.000 points on 
your pointcounter and the door will appear instantly. Otherwise not. Of you are
playing a two player game it is good enough when you have the 1 million in 
points combined.
So get some bonus rooms before (you need the candle and other bonus items to 
get to the gem rooms) to gather all the points.
This bonus room is important as it contains the green mirror, the last item
needed for the best ending.

So, what happens in the best ending?
You rescue your Girlfriends Betty and Patty and the forest turns back to normal 
green and there is a lot of love in the air. And you made it! Well, after the 
next 100 levels.
