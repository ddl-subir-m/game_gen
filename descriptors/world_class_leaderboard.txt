Modes of the Game
-----------------

There are three modes in which you can play.

 - Play the Game: This includes a full round of golf, straight from the tee to
                  the hole, with no interruptions.

 - Putting Green: Here, you are able to practice your putting, one of the key
                  aspects in golf, as it is most often how you get the ball
                  into the hole. This putting is exactly like it is in the main
                  game. Go to the generalization of play for further details.

 - Driving Range: Here, you are able to practice any non-putt shots; that is,
                  any shot not made on the green, though this is 
                  stereotypically use to describe practicing with your driver. 
                  This is also like in the main game; see the generalization of
                  gameplay for further details.

Generalized Gameplay
--------------------

When you first begin an actual game, you'll first pick one of four courses, the
number of players (one to four), their names, and, finally, levels.

When you begin a hole, you will obtain various information on the hole. This
will include hole number, player, par score, and wind direction. During this
time, you can press Up/Down on the D-Pad to choose a golf club, as below, and
Left/Right to adjust the desired trajectory. Use the 2 Button and the Topview
to choose which is best.

Use of the 1 Button will begin your shot taking. Look at the lower-right orange
meter. It is divided into two segments, as so:
  _____
 |  |  |   This top half is your power gauge, and the first used. As you hold
 |  |  |   down the 1 Button initially, this will fill on the left side with a
 |  |  |   white gauge. The higher, the more power. Release for the second
 |__|__|   stage of shooting.
 |     |
 |_ _ _|   Then the rest fills, top heading down. In the lower half, you can
 |     |   press 1 once more to shoot. If you're above the midline there, you
 |_____|   shoot a hook ball, which heads right. Below the midline is a slice
           ball, which curves left. The closer to the midline you are, the
           straighter your shot.

This generally will repeat for a bit until you reach the green near the hole.
It gets a bit more specialized there.

This is when you begin to putt the ball into the hole. Due to the usual flat
nature of all courses, you can aim straight for the hole. Here, you'll only
consider power and not timing. Therefore, look at how far you are from the
hole and try to release the 1 Button during the shot at the equivalent level
on the gauge.

There are usually eighteen holes played throughout the course of a single
match, and in a way similar to this.


---------------
Scoring Details
---------------

Each given hole will have a set "par" on it. The par is the number of shots it
ideally takes to finish a hole. If you go under this, you earn points (your
score is negative, but that's good), and if you go over, you lose points (you
gain positive points). Hitting exactly par neither hurts or helps you.

The number of shots you take can also be affected by two other things - water
hazards and out-of-bounds area. Both are considered out-of-bounds. This bad
shot will count against you, and you'll be penalized an additional shot. For
example, if you hit the water on your first shot, consider the next shot you
take your third and not the second.

At the end of the hole, the number of shots you take, minus the par, is your
score. If such is positive, you went over (bogey); if negative, you did good by
going under (birdie, eagle, albatross). And, of course, par is neither good or
bad.

For the purposes of this game, you'll be using basic stroke play rules. That is
to say, whoever has the better score at the end of eighteen holes wins. The
only reason I mention this is that some use a win-loss basis rather than an
overall score, and this is just to remove confusion.

To the curious, the relatively official names for various shots:

                     O----------------O-----------------O
                     |  Name of Shot  |  Score Changes  |
                     O----------------O-----------------O
                     |  Hole-in-One   |    (Par) - 1    |
                     |  Albatross     |        -3       |
                     |  Eagle         |        -2       |
                     |  Birdie        |        -1       |
                     |  Par           |        Â±0       |
                     |  Bogey         |        +1       |
                     |  Double Bogey  |        +2       |
                     |  Triple Bogey  |        +3       |
                     O----------------O-----------------O
