Three treasures which gave the kingdom of Daventry its power were stolen. The
magic mirror had the power to read the future, the shield protected the kingdom
from attack even against powerful armies and the chest had always remained full
of coins. King Edward the Benevolent had ruled over the kingdom for many years,
but remained without a son or daughter to inherit his throne. In his last days,
the King summons his favourite knight Sir Graham to this throne room. He tells
Graham about the treasures that were stolen, and that only the recovery of the
three items will restore power back to Daventry. Graham is promised that he
will become King over all of Daventry if he succeeds in this task.

===============================================================================


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.                            The Magic Mirror
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The game starts outside of Daventry castle, where a nearby bridge leads over a
moat containing two vicious alligators. Our first aim is to cross the bridge.
Start by using the arrow keys to move Graham down toward the bridge. Pressing
the same arrow key a second time stops Graham walking in that direction. Make
sure to walk onto the bridge from the top side, and not from the right side
which will often make Graham fall into the water. If it makes things easier,
you can use the end key and page down to walk diagonally over the bridge.

After safely making it over to the other side of the bridge, continue west to
the next area. Walk up the carpet in front of the castle and OPEN DOOR to enter
the main hall. Go north to the corner and then west to the throne room.
Approach the bottom step in front of the old King and BOW to him. TALK KING and
he will explain that he wants Graham to prove himself worthy of the throne by
bringing three items back to the castle: A magic mirror, a magic shield and a
magic chest. Press any key to return to the game.

Walk east and then south twice to exit the castle. Walk west across the bridge,
remembering to stay at the top of the bridge to avoid falling into the water,
and then continue west to an area with a rock in it. Walk behind the rock and
PUSH ROCK to reveal a hole in the ground. Make sure not to push the rock from
the front as it will crush Graham. GET DAGGER from the hole and then walk north
to the tree in the next area. CLIMB TREE to see a golden egg in a nest. Before
doing anything else, save the game by pressing F5.

With the game saved, walk carefully across the branch making sure to stay away
from the edges. Graham will not die if he falls from this branch, but saving
the game prevents you from having to climb up the tree again. The page up key
can be used to good effect here to walk diagonally up the branch. If you do
fall down from the tree at a certain point, F7 can be used to restore the game.
GET EGG from the nest in the middle of the tree. With the egg in the inventory
you can now walk off the branch to fall to the bottom of the tree.

Walk east, then north to a peaceful lake area where an elf should be walking
around. If he doesn't appear, leave and return the area until he does. TALK ELF
ELF and he will give Graham a ring that has the power to turn its owner
invisible. Before he leaves, the elf warns that the ring can only be used once.
Walk west twice to the well area. Walk behind the bucket in the well and CUT
ROPE using the dagger from the hole. The bucket will be added to Graham's
inventory. Walk to the top-right corner of the well and LOWER ROPE.

The rope is now dangling down into the darkness of the well, so CLIMB ROPE and
then press the down arrow key to descend into the well. The rope ends above a
pool of water at the bottom of the well. Continue down to the bottom of the
rope to fall into the water. As with all calm water in the game, Graham will
splash about helplessly until you tell him to SWIM. With Graham now calmly
swimming in the water at the bottom of the well, DIVE into the water.

An old bottle and a can litter the ground at the bottom of the pool, but they
can't be picked up. The hole at the bottom-left corner of the water looks more
interesting, so swim into it. Graham exits the water to find himself in the
cave of a fire-breathing dragon. Walk east to the water area to refill the
bucket and then return to the cave. Type the command to THROW WATER but don't
enter it yet. Walk up close to the dragon and then press enter to throw the
water over the dragon. The dragon leaves the cave, moving a big boulder on the
way. With the dragon gone, GET MIRROR near the boulder.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.                            The Magic Chest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The bucket is currently empty as it was used to extinguish the flames of the
dragon, so walk back through the hole at the right side of the cave to fill it
up with water again. Swim west back into the cave. Walk west through the hole
at the side of the boulder and then continue west to exit the cave. Outside,
walk south twice to arrive in an area with a stump. LOOK IN STUMP to see an old
pouch inside. GET POUCH. OPEN POUCH to see diamonds inside.

Walk west once to see a calm lake. You shouldn't need to get too close to the
edge of the lake, but if you do fall in then just start swimming. Walk north
twice from the lake area and then west once to arrive in a field with a group
of clovers. Walk to the four leaf clover and GET CLOVER. Walk south to the next
area. A fairy may appear in this area to cast a spell on Graham, protecting him
temporarily from the effects of monsters. If the fairy does not appear, just
keep exiting this area and returning to it until she does.

Walk west and GET CARROT from the garden. Walk north twice to an area with
rocks near a river. Be careful not to drop into the river, as it is flowing too
fast for Graham to be able to swim in it. Walk west to the next area and GET
BOWL on the grass. Don't read the word in the bowl or you won't be able to
finish the game with the maximum points. Walk west again and GET WALNUT below
the tree. OPEN WALNUT to see that it contains a nut made of gold.

From the walnut tree, walk north one screen and then east one screen. Walk onto
the beach near the powerful river and GET PEBBLES. Walk north and west three
times. Enter the house and GIVE BOWL TO WOODCUTTER. He is puzzled why Graham
has placed an empty bowl on his table, so say the word FILL to fill the bowl
with stew. Very grateful, the woodcutter and his wife offer their fiddle to
Graham. GET FIDDLE from the corner and then exit the house.

Walk south twice to see a gingerbread house in a clearing. Walk to the front
of the house and EAT HOUSE. OPEN DOOR to enter the house. Quickly walk over to
the bedroom at the right side of the house and wait in the bedroom. A witch
should enter the house. If the witch doesn't appear, exit the house and then go
back into the bedroom again until she does. The witch will move over to the
stove after she enters the house. Walk up to the witch and PUSH WITCH. With the
witch gone, the house is now safe to explore.

OPEN CUPBOARD. GET CHEESE on the shelf. Walk into the bedroom and GET NOTE on
the table. Exit the house and walk west once and south twice to the area with
the goat pen. OPEN GATE and enter the pen. SHOW CARROT to the goat and he will
start to follow Graham. Exit the pen and walk south three times and west once
to see a bridge. Cross the bridge and the goat will butt the troll off the
bridge. The bridge is now safe to cross, so continue west to the next area.

An old gnome will be walking around in this area. TALK GNOME and he will
challenge Graham to guess his name in three tries. An old fairy tale had a
character named Rumplestiltskin that also asked that his name be guessed in
three tries. Entering this name, the gnome mentions that the guess is close
but not quite right. Read the note found in the gingerbread house, which
mentions that it may be wise to think backwards. Rumplestiltskin backwards is
Nikstlitselpmur, which still doesn't work. The key is to reverse the letters
of the alphabet, so that A would become Z for example. When this method is
used on the word Rumplestiltskin, the gnome's name is found.

Tell the gnome that his name is IFNKOVHGROGHPRM and he will be astounded that
his name was guessed. He exits the area, leaving some beans on the ground. If
his name was not guessed, he leaves a key on the ground. GET BEANS or GET KEY.
Walk east twice to an area where flowers are growing in the soil. If you have
the beans, PLANT BEANS to see a beanstalk grow. CLIMB BEANSTALK and prepare
for one of the most difficult sections of the game. In the first screen Graham
will not die if he falls, but there are another three screens above this where
Graham will die if he falls from the beanstalk. Save frequently, and at the top
of the beanstalk Graham will step onto the Land of the Clouds.

If you didn't guess the gnome's name, then a different route has to be taken to
reach the Land of the Clouds. From the beanstalk soil, walk south twice to the
area where the bird appears. Walk east three times to see a door built into the
bottom of a mountain. USE KEY on the door to enter a cave with steps which lead
up to the Land of the Clouds. It is very easy to fall off the edge, so be sure
to save frequently on the way up. Use the page up key when walking up the first
set of steps, and the end key on the second set of steps. Go through the cave
exit at the top of the steps to enter the Land of the Clouds.

The beanstalk route leads to a cloud at the west side of the land, while the
mountain steps route leads to a cave exit at the east side of the land. From
the top of the beanstalk, walk east twice, south and then east twice to see a
hole in a tree. From the cave exit, just go south one screen to arrive in the
area with the hole in the tree. LOOK HOLE to see a sling. GET SLING. Walk
north, then west to see the fierce giant that guards the magic chest.

Walk behind the tree at the top-left corner of the area and stay there until
the giant falls asleep. It is easier to enter the area from the left side as
the giant starts further away. There are other ways of getting past the giant:
You can USE SLINGSHOT to fire the pebbles, or WEAR RING and then RUB RING,
although both of these methods don't give as many points. Whatever way is
chosen, the giant will fall onto the grass holding the chest. GET CHEST.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.                            The Magic Shield
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Walk east to the next area. Enter the cave and save at the top of steps. Use
the page down key to walk down the first set of steps, and the end key to walk
down the second set of steps. Exit the cave and then walk east to an area near
a lake. If you didn't talk to the elf in this area earlier, then talk to him
now to receive the magic ring. His main purpose in the game is to make things
easier when waiting for the giant to fall asleep, but at this point in the game
you may have already done that by hiding behind the tree. Collecting the ring
is also required when going for a maximum points.

Walk west four times, swimming through a lake on the second screen, to return
to the exit of the cave where the mirror was found. Exit and return to this
area until a bird appears and flies around the area. Walk behind the rock at
the right side of the area and JUMP when the bird flies down above Graham. The
bird carries Graham and drops him off in an area on the other side of a river.
Walk west and GET MUSHROOM. Walk back to the east and fall down the hole.

Graham lands in a cave after falling through the hole. Walk south and then west
to see a rat running about in front of a door. The rat is dangerous, so save
the game at this point. Walk up close and GIVE CHEESE TO RAT. It scrambles into
a hole in the wall and disappears. OPEN DOOR to enter a room with two
leprechauns that are under the power of the fourleaf clover that Graham is
carrying. PLAY FIDDLE and the leprechauns will dance out of the cave.

Walk south to the throne room. Before the fiddle was played, eleven normal
leprechauns and the King leprechaun were here and the King's magic prevented
Graham from getting close to him. After the fiddle has been played, only the
King remains. Seeing that all of his followers have left the cave, he leaves as
well, but forgets to take his sceptre with him.

GET SCEPTRE and GET SHIELD near the throne. Walk west up the steps to see a
small hole that Graham can not climb through due to his size. EAT MUSHROOM and
Graham will shrink to the size of a mouse. Before the effects can wear off,
walk through the hole to exit the cave. Almost immediately, Graham returns to
his original size. Walk east, north twice and then east to return to the castle
entrance. Carefully cross the bridge and then OPEN DOOR. Walk north and west to
the throne room. Approach the steps and BOW to the King.

In the ending, The King smiles and then rises from his throne. Graham walks up
to the throne and the King commends him on recovering the three treasures. As
the King walks forward, he stumbles and falls to the floor. In his dying words
he praises Graham for being a good and faithful servant, telling him that his
reward is well deserved and that the kingdom of Daventry is now his. Edward the
Benevolent then dies, and Graham begins his reign as the King of Daventry.

3.                              Character List

===============================================================================


BIRD
  Found one screen north-west of the well. If Graham jumps under the bird, it
  will carry him over to the other side of the Raging River.


DRAGON
  Found in the cave at the bottom of the well. Guardian of the magic mirror,
  the dragon can have its flames extinguished with a bucket of water. It can be
  killed with the dagger, but less points are given this way.


DWARF
  Found one screen north of the walnut tree, and on the steps leading up to the
  Land of the Clouds. The dwarf will steal a treasure that Graham is carrying.
  If no treasures are being carried, the dwarf will leave Graham alone.


ELF
  Found one screen north-east of the tree with the gold egg. When Graham talks
  to the elf, he will give Graham a ring which can make the owner invisible.


FAIRY
  Found one screen south of the clover tree. The fairy casts a spell that will
  temporarily protect Graham from enemies.


GIANT
  Found in the Land of the Clouds, the giant guards the magic chest. He can be
  killed with the slingshot, although more points are given if he falls asleep.
  This is done by hiding behind the tree at the top-left corner of the area.


GNOME
  Found on the other side of the bridge two screens north of the clover tree.
  The gnome will ask Graham to guess his name in three tries. If the answer is
  correct, magic beans are given. If the answer is incorrect, a key is given.


GOAT
  Found in the goat pen one screen west of the well. When shown a carrot, the
  goat will follow Graham to an area where it will butt a troll off a bridge.
  On the way, the goat can scare off many enemies.


GRAHAM
  The main character of the game. As the King's favourite knight, Graham has
  been asked to retrieve three stolen treasures from the land of Daventry.


LEPRECHAUNS
  Found in the leprechaun cave, they are harmless when Graham is holding the
  four-leaf clover. If he does not hold the clover they are deadly, as they
  will kill him if they catch him. The leprechauns enjoy music.


LEPRECHAUN KING
  Sitting on his throne in the leprechaun cave, the leprechaun King will only
  leave the cave when all of his guards have danced off due to Graham's fiddle
  playing. He leaves behind a magic shield and a sceptre.


KING EDWARD THE BENEVOLENT
  Found in the throne room of the castle. This elderly King has requested that
  Sir Graham should recover three magic treasures from the kingdom of Daventry.

  stand in front of the bush or the tree stumps to avoid being caught. The ogre
  will crush Graham if he catches him, but will stay away if he has the shield.


SORCERER
  Found one screen east of the witch's house. The sorcerer casts a spell that
  freezes Graham to the spot, although he will be able to move again after a
  while. Graham will be safe from the sorcerer if he has the shield.


RAT
  Found outside the entrance to the leprechaun cave. This hungry rat will run
  off after he has been given a piece of cheese. A treasure can also be given
  if Graham doesn't have the cheese, although this gives less points.


TROLL
  Found on all of the bridges surrounding the area with the gnome. He blocks
  the way, but will not harm Graham. The goat can butt the troll off the edge
  of the bridge. For less points, the troll moves when he is given a treasure.


WITCH
  Found one screen north of the well and in the gingerbread house, the witch
  was responsible for stealing the magic chest. After hiding when the witch
  enters her house, Graham can push her into the stove to defeat her.


WOLF
  Found one screen east of the well. A fast enemy, it is best to either avoid
  the area that the wolf inhabits or to walk walk at the bottom of the area so
  that an escape can be made if he appears. The shield will protect Graham.


WOODCUTTER
  Found in the house two screens south of the well. The man and his wife give
  Graham the fiddle in exchange for a bowl that can be filled by saying a word.


WOODCUTTER'S WIFE
  Found in the house two screens south of the well. Sitting at the table with
  the woodcutter, they let Graham have the fiddle in exchange for the bowl.

SHIELD
  Found in the throne room of the leprechaun cave. It is one of the three

7.                         Easter Eggs and Secrets

===============================================================================


ABOVE MAXIMUM POINTS
--------------------

It is possible to finish the game with 159 out of 158 points, one point above
the maximum amount. When the bowl is found one screen east of the walnut, do
not read the word inside it. If the word inside the bowl has been read before
it is put in the table in the woodcutter's house, then you will receive one
point for reading the word and no points for putting it on the table. If the
word has not been read, then you will receive two points for putting the bowl
on the table. So, do not read the bowl to get higher points.


COUNTING FINGERS
----------------

Giving the cheese to the rat outside the leprechaun cave gives a message that
says you might want to count your fingers. When this command is entered, a
message replies that Graham is relieved to see that he still has all of them.
The same message appears even if Graham hasn't give the cheese to the rat.


KNIGHT RIDER GNOME
------------------

When the gnome asks Graham to guess his name, typing Mikel gives the message
"What do you think I am, a car? This also won't get you a raise. Nice try.".
This refers to the character Michael Knight in the TV series Knight Rider,
which was made in the early 1980s. There is no more information on the raise
comment, as it seems to have been a joke between people working on the game.

8.                            Debug Information

===============================================================================


Hold Alt + D to access debug mode. Type "Get object" followed by a number to
collect any item in the game, or "TP" followed by a number to teleport to a
new location. "Pos" can be used to move Graham around in a room.
