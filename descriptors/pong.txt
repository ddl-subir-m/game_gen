      INTRODUCTION
o---------------------o

OK seriously, who has not heard of Pong? Most people probably know about Pong
before they even learned how to walk, talk, or read. You don't even have to be
a videogame player to know what Pong is. It is one of the very first games that
revolutionalized both the arcade, computer, and gaming ages. Created by Atari
in 1972, Pong is an video version of Table Tennis.

        STORY
o---------------------o

No story here, it is a simple objective of knocking the ball back and forth and
trying to get a goal (knock the ball of the sides of the screen).

o---------------------o
        CONTROLS
o---------------------o

The controls are fairly simple, you move your paddle up and down in an attempt
to bounce the ball back at your opponent via a turn dial.  The ball is served
automatically.

        GAMEPLAY
o---------------------o

2 paddles are on the screen. You insert the coin and play. You can choose to go
at it against the computer which will be difficult since the AI is real strong
or you play a two-player game. The two player game I say is very fair since you
have better concentration.

Sometimes the ball will hit the top and bottom of the screen. This will not go
off the screen and count as a score. Instead, it will bounce back into play and
still be hit back or cause the player to miss the ball and the opponent scores.

When hitting the ball, the spot the ball touches on the paddle will change the 
angle on the way back so it is possible to bounce the ball up and down several
times before it reaches the opponent.

The ball gets faster every time the ball is bounced back so it gets real crazy
after a while.

There is a time limit so whoever has the highest score at the end of the time
will be the winner. There is really nothing special about it , just bragging
rights.
