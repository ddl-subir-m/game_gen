Introduction                                                         [INTRO]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 20th edition of the Madden franchise is here, and what better way is there
to celebrate than my writing a guide for its predecessors? I've now written an
FAQ/Strategy Guide for all seven of the Super NES Madden games, so that's kind
of special. This is my shortest Madden guide, since there's not as much to say
about this game as the others.

While John Madden Football doesn't have today's graphics or updated rosters, it
has a decent playbook for its time and exciting music. The graphics aren't much
better than an NES game, and the animation can sometimes be jerky. That said,
you have to remember that this was one of the first games released for the
Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Some familiar features of later Madden
games aren't included, like season play, although there is a playoff mode.
Formations are pretty limited; there's no 3-4 defense, I-Formation, or single-
back sets. John Madden Football has no actual players (or even player numbers),
although all 28 NFL teams (as of 1991) are included. No substitutions can be
made, although you can choose between four different sets of offensive players.
Learning all the spins and other moves may take a few minutes, but it's not
like the ultra-complicated play control in the newer games.

---Regular Season---
Here you can play an exhibition game using the teams of your choice. You can
select the field type, weather, and quarter length, too.

---Pre-Season---
This is the same as a Regular Season game, except there's no play clock. You
can take as long as you want to call your plays.

---New Playoffs---
This lets you play a series of games based on the actual 1991 playoffs.

---Cont Playoffs---
Enter a password to resume a playoff in progress.

---Sudden Death---
Sudden Death is essentially an overtime period that matches up the teams of
your choice. The first team to score will win the game.

Offensive Playbook                                                   [OFFPB]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A few notes: When I use terms like "Y receiver" and "A receiver," I'm referring
to the buttons that correspond to the receivers. "Y receiver" and "X receiver"
can have a different meaning in real-life playbooks. Since you're playing an
old football video game, I'm assuming you have some grasp of football theory,
rules, and terminology; you know what a tight end or shotgun formation is. That
said, I'm still going to explain certain terms for the less football-savvy.
Remember that results may vary depending on defense, down, hashmarks, playing
surface, and other factors. No play will succeed 100% of the time. I've tried
to test each play against a variety of defenses, but there's still a chance I
may have misjudged a few plays. The five-receiver formation wasn't around in
the NFL in 1991, so don't go looking for any 5-WR sets or 7-DB "quarter"
defenses here, or zone blitzes, for that matter. For those of you who are
counting, there are 35 plays on offense and 64 plays in the defensive playbook.
While some of these plays (or plays that are very similar) appear in the
playbooks of newer Madden games, I don't recommend trying to use this guide
with any games other than the Super NES version of John Madden Football.

Far (6 plays)
===============================================================================
This formation is best for running, although it contains one passing play. The
only difference between the "Far" and "Near" formations is whether or not your
halfback is on the same side of the formation as the tight end.

---FB Trap Left---
Not the best running play in the book, even among fullback runs. If you run the
play the way it's drawn, you probably won't gain more than a couple of yards,
so you might prefer to run off right guard.

---HB Sweep Right---
On this play, the halfback takes the pitch and must run almost to the sideline
before turning. There's obviously a risk here, since a blitzing LOLB will often
stop you for a loss. However, a fast back can easily gain 5-10 yards.

---FB Counter---
Unless you have a very fast fullback, your back will be stuffed for a big loss,
since you take the pitch a considerable distance behind the line of scrimmage.
Not a good play.

---FB Lead---
The halfback lead blocks for the fullback, who runs between the left tackle and
left guard. This is a good way to use a fullback who can break tackles. Don't
be too fast in plowing through the line; wait for the blocking to set up before
making your move.

---Cross Right---
The split end (X) runs a very effective deep in. The tight end (A) is on an out
pattern, and the halfback (Y) will be available in the flat. 

---HB Screen---
Your primary option for this screen pass is, of course, the halfback (Y). A
fast halfback can easily get a touchdown if you throw a quick, hard pass. You
can also try the split end (X) on the corner or the tight end (A) on the out.

Near (6)
===============================================================================

---HB Trap Left---
This trap play is pretty reliable at earning four or more yards, although
you'll be stopped for a loss if the MLB is blitzing.

---FB Off Tackle---
Not a bad play, but hardly remarkable or memorable. It's difficult for your
fullback to build much momentum with this play. Running between the right guard
and right tackle is generally most effective.

---HB Counter---
In a counter play, the running back steps in one direction to fake out the
defense, and then he runs in the opposite direction. This is more like a plain
old sweep right, and it will frequently gain 10 yards. 

---HB Screen---
Your primary option for this screen pass is, of course, the halfback (A). A
fast halfback can get good yardage, especially versus a blitz, but against a
short zone, you'll have little luck. You can also throw deep to the streaking
receivers (Y and X), but they play so close together the defensive backs may
have an easy time covering them.

---Play Action---
This is more of a flood right than a play action. The halfback (X) is a good,
safe option in the flat. The flanker (Y) on the deep post can earn big yardage,
while the tight end (A) will need to be quick to gain anything more than five
yards.

---Cross In---
On this play action pass, your main target is the flanker (X) on the streak.
The tight end (A) runs a very short out that's good if you want to get the ball
off quickly, while the halfback (Y) faces too much traffic against a standard
4-3. It takes a little while for this play to get going, so try something else
if you're expecting a heavy blitz.

Pro Form (7)
===============================================================================
The Pro Form formation, also known as Split Backs or other names, is very 
similar to Far/Near. It's good for both running and passing, and it's probably
the formation I use most frequently. As the most popular formation of its time,
the Pro Form has the largest play selection of any set in the game.

---FB Center Trap---
This is another fullback run, which will be pretty effective if your fullback
runs well. Be patient and let the blockers block.

---HB Toss Left---
This is a good running play for more experienced players. If you can beat the
right cornerback, you should reach the sideline and score.

---HB Off Tackle---
The halfback runs between the right tackle and tight end or flanker. What more
can you say? This is a good general-purpose run that should consistently gain
good yardage with little risk. One of the best rushing plays in the game.

---FB Draw---
This is a relatively rare draw play to the fullback. It looks like the
quarterback's throwing, but he's not. This works well if the defense is playing
for the pass, but unless your fullback is fast, you'll lose big yardage against
a blitz. Not recommended.

---Down + Out---
The halfback (Y) is a very good option against blitzes and deep zones. The
tight end (X) on the post also works well against blitzes, while the flanker
(A) on the post is more of a deep threat. Overall, a nice play.

---Cross Pass---
The X receiver runs a post pattern that can be an interception hazard if the
safety picks him up. The flanker (A) goes deep, while the halfback (Y) in the
flat is a safe and remarkably effective option.

---Flea Flicker---
This play doesn't appear in the playbook, so the only way you can use it is by
calling Audible A (see the FAQs). The quarterback pitches out to the halfback,
who promptly returns the ball to the quarterback. From here, you can either run
or throw deep to a receiver. This is the riskiest play in the game, but it
frequently results in a massive gain.

Shotgun (6)
===============================================================================
The Shotgun formation is good for passing because of its "shotgun" snap - the 
quarterback gets the ball several yards behind the line of scrimmage instead of
from right under center. It isn't great for running, though. The John Madden
Football version of the shotgun formation has three receivers, one tight end,
and one running back. 

---FB Draw---
This can earn a surprising amount of yardage if the defense is expecting a
pass. Either hit the hole between the pulling right guard and the center, or
run off left tackle.

---Flood Right---
If he's open, go for the flanker (X) on the deep post. Throwing to the tight
end (Y) will succeed against deep zones. Your last option is the back (A), who
will take a while to get open.

---QuickOuts---
Try a quick, hard pass to the Y receiver on the out. The A receiver runs
something more like a slant. If the middle is clear, throw to the halfback (X)
on the slant.

---Post Up---
Your best option is the split end (Y) on the deep post. If he's double-covered,
look for the shorter tight end (X) or the A receiver on the out-and-up. This
play will shred short zones and slow cornerbacks in man coverage.

---Deep Outs---
Your main target is the split end (Y) on the deep out, who will probably score
a touchdown if he catches the ball. Also look for your interior receivers (X
and A) on posts. This play is best if you need quick yardage, especially in a
two-minute drill.

---Flag Left---
The flanker (A) runs a flag pattern, while the X and Y receivers cross on the
left side of the field. Y may be a good option if you need to get out of
bounds.

Goal Line (6)
===============================================================================
This formation is full of plays that are useful only in short-yardage
situations, especially near the goal line. There are two backs, two tight ends,
and a receiver.

---FB Cut Right---
The goal of this counter play is to avoid the congestion in the middle by
running off right tackle, although sometimes it's also possible to plunge
through the middle. While nothing is guaranteed inside the five, this play
works very effectively, especially when you need two or three yards.

---FB Lead Left---
This is a halfback dive. If you need 1-2 yards, FB Lead Left is a good play to
use.

---HB Pull---
A good choice if you only need a yard or two. It's not particularly glamorous,
though. As with FB Lead Left, you may prefer to run around the line for the
score.

---FB Lead Right---
Just like FB Lead Left, although slightly more effective.

---HB Cut Left---
Another fullback dive, but this is a bit riskier than HB Pull.

---Flood Left---
This is the only passing play in the Goal Line formation. Everyone heads left.
The Y receiver on the out is your most effective option, as he's the least
likely to be in considerable traffic. You could also roll out to the right and
run for the score.

Field Goal (2)
===============================================================================
Use the "Special Teams Field Goal" players to access these plays.

---Field Goal---
This play lets you kick a field goal. What a surprise! Don't try to kick a
field goal unless you're inside the opposition 30 or so, though. In newer
Madden games, this is the play to select when you want to kick an extra point
after a touchdown, although the two-point conversion wasn't around in the NFL
in 1992.

---Fake FG---
Fake field goals are very risky, so use them carefully. Your best bet is the B
option on this standard pass-based fake field goal. Ignore the kicking meter.
As with fake punts, fake field goals are most dangerous against human
opponents.

Punt (2)
===============================================================================
These plays will appear only if you select the "Special Teams Punt" player set.

---Punt---
When it's fourth down and too far to kick, you will usually want to punt. And 
this is the play to select when you wish to do so.

---Fake Punt 1---
As you know, fake punts are risky. This is the pass form of the fake punt. Look
for your Y, X, and A receivers and throw to whoever's open. Your X man is
safest, while Y and A are best for longer gains. This play can be quite
effective against human players, if just for the shock value alone.

Defensive Playbook                                                   [DEFPB]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm not going to be as verbose on the defensive plays. Instead, I'm just going 
to give a few details about each play; you can tell a lot just from the names 
and diagrams.

4-3 (18)
===============================================================================
The 4-3 system has four defensive linemen, three linebackers, two cornerbacks,
and two safeties. It's the primary defensive set of a little less than half of
the teams in the actual 1991 NFL season. Most teams actually used the 3-4
system, but this game doesn't have three-linemen defensive sets.

(Cover)
---Full Blitz---
All three linebackers are blitzing, in addition to a safety. The offensive line
won't be able to hold back the eight-man rush for long. However, the receivers
will be in single (or no) coverage, since only three guys are defending the
pass.

---Wide Zone 1---
Seven men are in coverage, so passing won't be easy. The quarterback won't be
under much pressure, though.

---Medium Zone---
This is a medium zone defense, which contains the pass effectively but may have
difficulty against the ground game, especially runs off guard.

---Short Zone 1---
Needless to say, this is a short zone defense. It's designed to contain the
short pass without being too weak against the rushing game and deep threats.

---Man/Zone 1---
A balanced defense.

---Triple Zone---
Triple Zone will usually put the opposition flanker in triple coverage, but the
split end will have just one man to beat. The linebackers are playing man-to-
man to stop the run.

(Read)
---Wide Zone 2---
This is a fairly standard zone defense.

---Short Zone 2---
This short zone is very similar to Short Zone 1.

---Man Left---
A man-to-man defense, with more protection on the left side of the field than
the right.

---Man Right---
The mirrored form of Man Left. Surprise!

---Left LB Blitz---
The left-side linebacker (technically the RLB) is blitzing in this man-to-man
defense.

---Right LB Blitz---
Basically a mirrored form of LLB Blitz. One safety plays very deep.

(Control)
---Cheat Left---
All of your linemen rush toward the left side of the defensive line. The idea
is to block the left tackle and allow the blitzing RLB to come around to sack
the quarterback or stop left outside rushes. It'll take some time for this to
happen, though, especially if you don't have a fast linebacker. I recommend
that you control the RLB if you want a sack. The receivers and tight end will
be matched up in single coverage.

---Jam Middle---
Both outside linebackers blitz, while the linemen rush toward the middle of the
line. This play is good at stopping the inside run but is weaker against
sweeps and passes to the flats.

---Cheat Right---
The same as Cheat Left, only to the right. Consider taking control of the LLB.
Even if you don't get the quarterback, you might be able to tip his pass or
stop a sweep right.

---Wide Zone 3---
Four men are playing deep to protect against the long ball, but watch out for
runs and passes up the middle.

---Man/Zone 2---
The linebackers play to stop the run, while both safeties play deep to back up
the cornerbacks. This looks a little like a Cover-2. A good first-down call.

---MLB Blitz---
The middle linebacker blitzes, crushing the inside running game and putting
enormous pressure on the quarterback. A pass up the middle could be dangerous,
though. This is known as Monster Blitz in John Madden Football '93.

Nickel (10)
===============================================================================
The Nickel defense is best used in passing situations, as there are five 
defensive backs instead of four.

(Cover)
---Full Blitz---
Both linebackers blitz. Two defensive backs are also blitzing, but they're too
far away from the line of scrimmage to do anything unless you're controlling
them.

---Bump + Run---
In Bump & Run, the linebackers play outside to stop outside runs. The defensive
backs play man coverage.

---Full Zone---
Every zone is covered here, including the flats. However, this play is very
vulnerable to an inside run, particularly a draw play.

---Deep Zone---
Everyone goes deep, so use this only when your opponents are in a two-minute 
drill and are trying to gain yards quickly. It's best against a "Hail Mary" or 
similar play.

---Circle Zone---
This is a zone defense that's shaped in a circle. The weak point is the middle
of that circle, although even short passes up the middle aren't going to cause
too much damage.

---Safety Blitz---
Two sets of defensive linemen are stunting, while the center safety comes
charging forward. He won't reach the QB unless you take control of him manually
or use an A audible, though. This safety charge could leave a gap in the deep
zone in the center of the field.

(Read)
---Tight Man---
One linebacker is blitzing, and the defensive backs are in man coverage. The
defensive line is rushing towards the center, so the inside run won't be able
to do much, but an off left tackle could be dangerous.

---Double Blitz---
Woof! Both linebackers are blitzing, so this is a good way to put pressure on
the quarterback without forsaking receiver coverage. This play is called Red
Dog in the next version of this game.

---Double SE---
Identical to Double FL, except this puts the split end (or usually the flanker)
in double coverage.

---Deep Zone---
This too is in the Cover playbook.

---Double FL---
This double-teams the flanker, or more commonly, the split end. A fine way to
shut down a particularly dangerous receiver.

---Bump + Run---
This play is also found in the Cover section of the Nickel playbook.

Dime (9)
===============================================================================
The Dime formation is even more pass-oriented, with six defensive backs and
just one linebacker. Since it's weak against most running plays, especially the
inside run, the Dime should generally be reserved for prevent situations.

(Cover)
---Double Blitz---
The second cornerback and linebacker blitz, with the other five defensive backs
providing the other assignments.

---Center Blitz---
The lone linebacker blitzes, and the secondary plays man coverage.

---Short Zone---
The cornerbacks and linebacker protect against the short pass, while your 
safeties drop back to provide a last line of defense.

---Deep Zone 1---
The classic prevent defense. All of your defensive backs head deep to prevent 
the big play. Because of its passive nature, you definitely don't want to use
it except when necessary.

---Deep Zone 2---
This deep zone stops the outside pass but may be vulnerable against passes in
the flat. Good in a two-minute drill.

---CB Blitz---
One of the cornerbacks blitzes the quarterback here, while the rest of the 
secondary is able to fill the hole.

(Read)
---Double SE---
This play double-teams the receiver lined up on the right side of the offense,
which is usually the flanker, not the split end.

---Double FL---
This play usually double-teams the split end.

---Safety Blitz---
One of your safeties will be blitzing, but unless you take manual control of
Him or use an A audible, you won't come near the quarterback. The LB is also
rushing.

---Short Zone---
The last three plays are all redundancies of the Cover set.

---Deep Zone 1---
This is the same as the Deep Zone 1 found in the Cover portion of the playbook.

---Deep Zone 2---
Another redundancy.

Big (9)
===============================================================================
The Goal Line formation counters the offensive version of the Goal Line. This 
should only be used near the goal line or possibly in certain obvious short-
yardage situations.

(Cover)
---Man Left 1---
In this man coverage system, the safety provides extra coverage on the left
side of the field.

---Safety Blitz---
One of the defensive backs will blitz.

---Man Right 1---
Similar to Man Left 1, except the safety covers the right side of the field,
and two pairs of linemen are on stunts.

(Read)
---Man Right 2---
Basically a mirrored Man Left 2.

---Zone/Man---
This is a man-to-man defense that's good against the pass down the middle.

---Man Left 2---
This is more aimed at stopping the pass and the outside left run.

(Control)
---Right---
Very similar to Left.

---Center---
This is more geared toward stopping the inside run.

---Left---
This is a general-purpose goal line defense that rushes toward the left side of
the line.

Special Teams (3)
===============================================================================
These plays are designed to defend against punts and field goals.

---Punt Block---
Here your team goes all out trying to block the punt, but you won't be able to 
get a good return.

---Punt Return---
Here your personnel will be blocking for your return man in an attempt to get a
good return.

---Special Teams Field Goal---
Use this if you know your opponent will be kicking a field goal.

---Prevent---
The most conservative pass defense in the game. All of your defensive backs
head deep to prevent the big play. There are only three down linemen. Because
of its passive nature, you definitely don't want to use it except when you're
expecting a "Hail Mary."

FAQs and General Tips                                                [NOTES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: What plays are audibles?
A: In John Madden Football, you can't set audibles manually. Each audible can
be used regardless of your set or formation.

Offense
Y: Pro Form FB Draw
B: Far Cross In
A: Pro Form Flea Flicker

Defense
Y: 4-3 stunt
B: Normal 4-3 defense
A: Safety blitz

Q: What's the difference between each player set?
A: Before calling an offensive play, you must choose between six different sets
of players. Unless you're kicking a field goal or punting, you'll have four
options to choose from on normal plays. The player positions will not differ
depending on the team you select; for example, the fourth-string wide receiver
will always be the flanker in the Big set, whether you're using the Chiefs or
Oilers.

Normal: Your top two wide receivers, a tight end, your starting halfback, and
a fullback: Your normal setup. Use this when you're in the Pro-Form, Far, or
Near formations.

Fast: This set features four wide receivers and your backup running back. This
should be selected exclusively when using the Shotgun formation, because the
lack of a tight end and fullback will make running difficult in other
formations. Also, you'll have your third receiver replacing the normal
halfback.

Hands: This can work when using the Shotgun formation or when you know you'll
be passing from a two-back system. Your standard starting halfback will be the
fullback, and the backup HB will play halfback. Your third receiver will play
split end and your fourth receiver will be the tight end, while the standard
flanker remains in the game.

Big: This two-tight end set works well in the Goal Line formation, but it might
also be worth a try when you know you'll be running in the Pro-Form, Far, and
Near formations. The tight end replaces the split end, and your fourth receiver
inexplicably becomes the flanker.

Special Teams Field Goal: It's what it says: Field goal plays.

Special Teams Punt: Pick this set when you punt.

Q: How do I use a hurry-up offense?
A: You can't. Sorry.

Q: How do I kick an onside kick?
A: As in real life, onside kicks are very difficult to execute properly. First
press A to call a kickoff audible, and then press Y to change your team's
alignment. Press B to start the power bar, and hold right on the control pad to
angle the kickoff toward the side where all your players are. You want to stop
the power bar when it's on the way down. It takes a lot of practice to do this
right, and even still your odds aren't great.

Q: Where's the Kneel Down play?
A: There isn't one. If you need to run out the clock without risking a fumble,
try something like FB Lead Right from the Goal Line formation. Another option is
to select a passing play and dive backwards right after you take the snap.

Q: Is there fatigue in this game?
A: No. No matter how fast a player runs, no player ever gets fatigued. Players
could first tire in Madden '97.

Q: What makes artificial turf different from natural grass?
A: Players have slightly better traction on artificial turf than on real grass
(and in real life, players got really bad injuries on Astroturf). Additionally,
rain and especially snow makes your footing much worse.

Q: What's the best way to put pressure on the opposing quarterback?
A: Select the middle linebacker. Charge past the center and squash the 
quarterback! Even better, start running toward the line of scrimmage before the 
snap to get a running start. There's another way, too...

Q: Where is the line of scrimmage?
A: According to this game's nearsighted referee, it's at the feet of the
offensive linemen, not the ball. With a little practice, you can line up a
safety or other fast player in the "neutral zone" and squash the quarterback,
deflect the pass, or stop the runner for a loss. This works especially well
from the Punt Rush play when you know the defense will punt.

Q: Why is the computer controlling my quarterback?
A: If you don't press any buttons after the snap, the computer takes over. The
same goes on defense. You can usually generate better results than the
computer, though.

Q: How do I call a timeout?
A: From the pause screen, just press A, assuming you have one or more timeouts
remaining. As you probably know, timeouts stop the game clock, so they're
useful in a two-minute drill or when you're about to get a delay of game
penalty.

Q: What penalties appear in this game?
A: Basically, you can get a delay of game penalty if you take too long to call 
your play on offense, and on defense you can get called for offsides by moving 
past the line of scrimmage before the snap. A few other penalties are rare,
like illegal procedure (kicking the ball out of bounds on a kickoff). 

Q: What should I choose when I win the toss?
A: It doesn't matter, although it's more fun to receive first. If you're 
deciding the goal to defend, you might want to have a tailwind on the kickoff. 
But it doesn't matter at all.

Q: What other tips do you have?
* The set, formation, and play assigned to the B button is always "Madden's
Choice." If you're too lazy or indecisive to call your own plays, just keep
pressing B and you'll get a reasonable play for your situation. Also, on
passing plays, the B receiver should generally be your #1 target.
* This is common sense, but if you have a good running back and a weak passing
game (Indianapolis is a good example), run the ball a lot. Likewise, if you
pass well but can't run (like Miami), you'll want to keep the ball in the air.
* Run straight if you want to keep going fast; zig-zags slow you down.
* Blitzes don't just increase the chances of a sack; they also make it easier
to deflect passes.
* Remember you can move your defenders a little past the line of scrimmage
before the snap, making it easier to sack the opposing quarterback.
* If you're playing on an emulator, assign the Y, B, and A buttons to the X, C, 
and V keys, respectively, to ease play-calling.

Q: What other notes do you have for the game?
A: Just a few miscellaneous tidbits:
* The New York Jets are known as New Jersey in this game, and the Los Angeles
Raiders are called Oakland.
* I don't include a team stats section because there's no objective way to rate
the teams.
* You might enjoy slamming into opposing players after the whistle blows. You
won't even get called for unnecessary roughness for doing so.
* In John Madden Football '93, the "Control" set is known as "Attack."
* John Madden still has blond hair on the opening screen! As with many of the
earlier Madden games, he's shown holding a football.
