 Not surprisingly, for an FMV adventure, the control scheme is fairly simple.
 There's no way to change the controls once you've started the game, however;
 the only window of opportunity is when selecting 'New Game' from the main
 menu. [Buttons without a function're omitted from list.]

 A: Draw/holster blaster
 B: Cancel
 C: Shoot

01) ACT 1: SNATCH                                                        [WK01]
_______________________________________________________________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Snatcher is a menu-driven text adventure game, and as such, has a pretty low
 learning curve. The story is separated into three acts, the first of which
 introduces our protagonist, Gillian Seed. He's been recruited by the JUNKER
 agency to fight Snatchers, mechanical beings masquerading as humans in order
 to steal their identities. 

 The walkthrough will list the minimal procedures to complete the story, but
 to get the full experience, new players are recommended to inspect options
 multiple times and dawdle a bit. Why? Because the script is very well-made,
 and there's often new observations or conversations that play on repeat
 searches. It's one of the crowning achievements of Snatcher, so don't pass
 'em by! [During the walkthrough's course, I'll note any interesting tidbits,
 too, so don't worry about missing 'em. Also, the order listed isn't always
 set in stone, so don't feel obligated to follow it verbatim!]

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • ENTER once
 • TALK at OPERATOR (who introduces herself as Mika Slayton)
 • ASK about JUNKERS, NEO KOBE, MIKA
 • ENTER again (to start grand tour)
 • Pick CHIEF'S OFFICE (you're rerouted here if you pick anything else)
 • ASK about JUNKERS, then SNATCHERS
 • ASK about JUNKER AUTHORITY, then NAVIGATORS
 • ASK about JUNKER DUTIES and JUNKER STAFF

 After exhausting the conversation options, Gillian obtains the JUNKER I.D.
 card and some CASH, two items now available in the Possessions menu. Chief
 Cunningham says Harry (in Engineering) has some equipment ready, so that's
 the next stop -- although other places are available for exploration, too.

 • EXIT to ENGINEERING ROOM
 • EXIT to DETECTIVE'S ROOM -.
 • EXIT to COMPUTER ROOM     |- Doable in any order
 • EXIT to SHOOTING RANGE   -'
 • EXIT to ENGINEERING ROOM
 • ASK about NAVIGATORS to meet Metal Gear

 Metal Gear is Gillian's navigation robot and, during adventures, his "partner
 in crime." In addition to providing some much-needed humor, Metal Gear pulls
 his weight function-wise: it has a videophone, savepoint system, flashlight,
 and can carry evidence inside. [This is explained in a conversation below.]

 • ASK about BLASTER to obtain the titular weapon (doesn't appear in inventory)
 • ASK about METAL GEAR, BLASTERS, SNATCHERS

 At this point, Metal should get a videophone call from Jean Jack Gibson, the
 group's other "runner," or Snatcher-eliminator. He'll say he wants backup at
 the abandoned factory.

 • USE METAL GEAR to SAVE (recommended as it's the first chance to do so)
 • ENTER TURBOCYCLE and pick FACTORY RUINS

ABANDONED FACTORY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • EXIT TURBOCYCLE
 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE any option (x8) until a scream is heard
 • ENTER the factory
 • MOVE and ADVANCE
 • LOOK at LITTLE JOHN
 • INVESTIGATE LITTLE JOHN, then MEMORY CHIP
 • USE METAL GEAR to REPORT ANALYSIS RESULTS on "LITTLE MEMORY"

 Metal then says that his videophone transmissions are being affected by the
 presence of Snow-9, a bio-engineered pollen with its own backstory. This'll
 constantly play a part in the game, mostly serving to keep one from using the
 videophone.

 • MOVE and ADVANCE (x2)
 • LOOK at BODY
 • INVESTIGATE GIBSON's CORPSE (x2), then RIGHT HAND, to get HAIR & SKIN SAMPLE
 • INVESTIGATE GIBSON's CORPSE again, then ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 
 • INVESTIGATE GIBSON > CLOTHING (x2)
 • INVESTIGATE the KEY and SCRAP OF PAPER to get them as evidence
 • INVESTIGATE HAIR and SKIN SAMPLE
 
 At this point, Metal's motion detector should go off, showing two shadowy
 figures running off in the distance.

 • MOVE and ADVANCE
 • LISTEN
 • LOOK and INVESTIGATE the FRONT
 • INVESTIGATE the MOTION DETECTOR

 Metal will hear a weird beeping noise. 

 • RETREAT
 • MOVE and RETREAT (x2)
 • LOOK at LITTLE JOHN

 The game will now remind the player about saving in situations like this.
 Gillian gives an additional comment if he hasn't saved even once since going
 inside, too.

 • MOVE and RETREAT

 At this point, Gillian will have his first actual battle, against insectors
 (those spiderlike robots Metal mentioned). Luckily for those who used the
 shooting range at HQ, all battles are in the exact same format. Gillian will
 have to defeat the monsters as they appear (each occupies 1 of the 9 spots)
 using his blaster, which must be drawn first with A-button. The fight probably
 won't be that taxing, but just in case, that's what y'saved for. As a curio,
 the outcome of this battle is referenced elsewhere, in the next section; if
 Gillian gets a game over, Metal mentions it next time one's in the shooting
 range (much to Gillian's chagrin).

 • MOVE to the EXIT

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Gillian arrives here automatically after exiting the factory, and goes to
 the Chief's office. In light of the circumstances, Gillian has options to
 console some of the NPCs around.

 • MOVE to ENGINEERING ROOM (scene removes Little John's MEMORY CHIP)
 • LOOK at HARRY
 • LOOK at BRANDY BOTTLE
 • INVESTIGATE the BRANDY BOTTLE (the number 39-5644 is noticed)

 Like Mika, Harry won't be in the mood for grunt work, so the chip's analysis
 will have to wait 'til later on.

 • MOVE to DETECTIVE'S ROOM
 • INVESTIGATE the LOCKER
 • INVESTIGATE Jean's COAT (finds chess piece)
 • INVESTIGATE the CHESS PIECE (entered into evidence)
 • INVESTIGATE NEAR DESK
 • INVESTIGATE the DESK DRAWER to find it's locked
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > KEY -- this opens the drawer
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the DISK (entered into evidence)
 • INVESTIGATE the CAPSULE to learn its contents (Metal records findings)
 • MOVE to FRONT
 • ASK Mika about BUFFALO RESTAURANT (x2)
 • ASK about NAPOLEON (x2)

 Mika will suggest tracking down Jean's informant Napoleon, saying he must've
 left a clue to his whereabouts, perhaps a videophone number...? Ahh, that's
 right, that weird number we found on Harry's bottle! [There's a funny convo
 if you call Napoleon immediately without being tipped off, or if you give the
 password without looking it up, where Metal is suspicious of how Gillian knew
 the answer.]

 • USE METAL GEAR > VIDEOPHONE
 • CALL 39-5644 to reach Napoleon

 Napoleon will ask for a password based off the historical figure Napoleon,
 which can be looked up at HQ's computer. [Metal suggests this if you fail the
 first time.] Correctly input the last part of the informant's phrase -- either
 (the 100-year) REIGN or (the revolution) IS ENDED -- and he'll establish a
 meeting at Alton Plaza. Naturally that location's now visitable.

 While leaving HQ, Mika will ask about the last time Gillian talked with his
 wife. He'll be reminded her number's written down at home. This is entirely
 optional, of course, but if you want to keep up appearances... The real leads
 are the Napoleon and Jean Jack's desk items. Heading to his house is also
 available.

GILLIAN'S APARTMENT [OPTIONAL]
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • MOVE > GO INSIDE
 • LOOK at SHELF
 • INVESTIGATE the PHOTO to learn Jamie's number (39-3444)
 • USE METAL GEAR > VIDEOPHONE

 At this point, you can talk about work, going on a date, that sort of stuff.
 The conversation's length is left up to the player. However, now that you've
 learned what a videophone number looks like, if you inspected the brandy
 bottle at HQ, you'll realize those digits aren't random gibberish.

GIBSON'S HOUSE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • INVESTIGATE the HOUSE
 • KNOCK on the front door
 • TALK to the naturally suspicious Katrina
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > JUNKER I.D.

 At this point, Katrina will say a real Junker would know her father's age.
 This hasn't been explicitly stated anywhere yet, and it requires going back
 to Headquarters and looking up Gibson on the computer. [Input subsequent
 wrong answers to the question and Metal will remind Gillian of this fact.
 You can keep answering until you guess it right, too.]

 • ANSWER QUESTION > GIBSON'S AGE > 55

 Katrina will still be understandably cautious and ask another question, this
 time about herself. Using the Jordan computer at Headquarters reveals all the
 information needed. [Subsequent wrong answers will earn Gillian a reminder
 from Metal, to which Seed wonders if there's other female info in Jordan's
 databanks. Also, inputting lewd answers, such as "ass," may give a funnier
 response from Katrina. The amount of incorrect answers seems to affect
 nothing.]

 • ANSWER QUESTION > ABOUT KATRINA > BIRTHMARK > HEART > THIGH

 With that, Gillian gets entrance and can start the questioning. [Note that
 if he hits on Katrina too much, she'll throw him out. The easiest way to
 rectify the situation is by knocking on the door until she caves, at which
 time Gillian can't hit on her any longer.]

 • ASK Katrina ABOUT GIBSON
 • MOVE to the STUDY
 • LOOK at the WINDOW (unlocks Backyard Garden)
 • SHOW Katrina the DISK from the inventory
 • ASK ABOUT PC68
 • INVESTIGATE the COMPUTER
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > DISK

 The ensuing scene reveals why snatchers are nocturnal creatures, and also
 gives a checklist for outing them: (1) investigate their skin (2) smell the
 skin; cancerous cells give off a pungent odor (3) the detection of Snow-9
 biopollen typically heralds a snatcher's presence (4) year-round sunscreen
 usage. Gibson states he also found the snatchers' skin treatment hospital,
 but doesn't tell where...

 • LOOK at DESK (opens up new options)
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE BOTTLE (SUNSCREEN put into inventory)
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE PHOTO (GIBSON'S PHOTO put into inventory)

 After all this is done, there'll be a scene where the pet doberman Alice
 starts barking in the backyard; Seed automatically moves there.

 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE any option (x7)
 • RETURN TO STUDY
 • MOVE to LIVING ROOM, then EXIT
 • ENTER TURBOCYCLE

 If you've talked with Napoleon and established a meet, it's time to visit
 Alton Plaza; if you haven't, see the previous Junker HQ section and square
 that portion away.

ALTON PLAZA
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 This popular hangout is where Gillian waits for Napoleon. Note that if one
 watches the background's big-screen ad long enough, the number for Plato's
 Cavern (69-1170) will appear. Same goes for the Konami (34-5678) number.

 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE any option (x6)
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > JUNKER I.D.
 • TALK ABOUT GIBSON
 • ASK about BUFFALO CUISINE RESTAURANT
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > CASH
 • ASK about BUFFALO CUISINE RESTAURANT
 • ASK about OUTER HEAVEN
 • ASK > OUTER HEAVEN > ABOUT CLUB
 • ASK > OUTER HEAVEN > LOCATION OF CLUB
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > CASH
 • ASK about PLATO'S CAVERN, then the LOCATION OF STORE

 Napoleon will say a club named Outer Heaven is the only place that serves
 buffalo since the ban went into effect. However, one can't get in without
 wearing a mask from Plato's Cavern. Since Napoleon doesn't tell the store's
 location, there's only one thing to do.

 • USE METAL GEAR > VIDEOPHONE > 69-1170
 • ASK > LOCATION OF STORE

 At this point, Gillian should have both the Cavern & Outer Heaven as available
 turbocycle spots. [If for some reason you sent Napoleon home early, you'll
 have to reorganize another meeting or just reload from the last save.] Before
 leaving, there's a few more scenes to experience, optional though they are.

 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE (x30ish) to unlock PICK UP WOMAN option
 • PICK UP WOMAN (x4) for some hilarious girl trouble

 You can also find the Cupid Love Line (55-6666) number and a fortune-teller
 scene by repeatedly searching the crowd, too.

PLATO'S CAVERN
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Remember, you have to call the number (69-1170) found at Alton Plaza in order
 to reach this place! First, let's get the mandatory stuff out of the way.

 • MOVE > ENTER STORE
 • LOOK at WALL (x2)
 • BUY > MASK > MUMMY or MOAI

 If you want a little foreshadowing, ask about Gibson and show the clerk his
 photo (if you got it from Katrina's house) to learn someone recently bought a
 large supply of sunscreen... Hmmmm... Anyway, on the street there's a funny
 optional scene where Gillian and Metal can try Neo Kobe Pizza:

 • SMELL (x1)
 • INVESTIGATE the FOOD STAND (x2)
 • SMELL (x1)
 • EAT NEO KOBE PIZZA

 "My pizza! I want my PIZZA!" Truly those words echo in all of us at some
 point! Heh heh... Now that a mask's been bought, it's time to visit Outer
 Heaven and investigate that buffalo... Make sure you have Gibson's picture
 or some backtracking'll be necessary.

OUTER HEAVEN
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > MASK
 • MOVE > GO INSIDE

 If you haven't gotten a mask at Plato's Cavern, the doorman won't allow Seed
 passage; however, he does namedrop the store, so there's that lead.

 • LOOK at DANCER
 • CALL the DANCER (Isabella)
 • ASK ABOUT GIBSON
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > PHOTO > GIBSON'S PHOTO (x2)
 • ASK ABOUT GIBSON
 • ASK ABOUT THAT MAN
 • ASK ABOUT THAT MAN > MAN'S DESCRIPTION

 At this point, Gillian can ask Isabella about "the regular"'s facial shape,
 type of eyes, nose, mouth, hair and age. Since she can't come down to the
 station, the player has to remember the info to create the composite sketch
 later on. Once all the questions've been asked, that ends the mandatory part
 of the club scene.

 But don't leave yet. Keep asking Isabella on a date (Ask > Videophone Number)
 and she'll eventually spill the beans after six or seven attempts: 39-6004.
 Other notable things include: (1) ordering food and drink for some enjoyable
 scenes (2) looking at the customers dressed like circa-1994 Konami stars, and
 the hilarious observations, particularly about Castlevania (3) flashing one's
 Junker I.D., which gets Gillian kicked out of the club...not recommended if
 you're still searching for info.

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 With details on Jean's suspect, it's time to create a digital sketch.

 • MOVE to the COMPUTER ROOM
 • USE JORDAN > USE CARD > CREATE MONTAGE
 • FACIAL SHAPE > 3
 • EYES > 6
 • NOSE > 1
 • MOUTH > 3
 • HAIR STYLE > 2
 • SCAN DATABASE

 Gillian gives some clues about what Isabella said, but the player has to
 remember most of it him/herself. If one creates a montage that doesn't fit
 perfectly, no matches will be found. However, when one finally does hit the
 jackpot, two suspects are located: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Their
 apartments are available spots via the turbocycle, now.

IVAN'S APARTMENT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 In the grand scheme of things, this section of events must be done first.
 Note: if Gillian hasn't called Jamie in this Act yet, neither suspect will
 be at their apartment, and Metal will suggest resting at home (a subtle clue
 to where Jamie's videophone number is). After having a conversation with the
 wife, Ivan's events can be done.

 • LOOK at AREA, then the FREEMAN
 • ASK ABOUT IVAN
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > PHOTO > MONTAGE PHOTO
 • ASK ABOUT IVAN

 Asking about the background is the only chance to learn the 30-2501 number,
 the freeman's dad.

 • MOVE to ROOM 301
 • LOOK at AREA
 • INVESTIGATE the METER
 • LOOK at DOOR
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the PLATE
 • KNOCK (x2)
 • TALK (x2)

 When Ivan opens the door, he'll be packing heat! Quickly draw your blaster
 and disarm him like a pro.

 • INTERROGATE (x2)
 • LOOK at IVAN, AROUND ROOM, then at the TROPHY
 • INVESTIGATE IVAN, his GUN, AROUND the ROOM, and the revealed GARBAGE

 Gillian and his partner will then move into the bathroom.

 • LOOK at SHELF and AROUND ROOM
 • INVESTIGATE the BOTTLE and AIRBOARD
 • LOOK at PLASTIC BAG, then INVESTIGATE it
 • INVESTIGATE the BATHTUB RESIDUE

 The ensuing scene will confirm what was patently obvious. Now it's off to the
 next suspect...

FREDDY'S APARTMENT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Similar to the last pad, Gillian will get nowhere unless he's called Jamie
 at least once. Remember, Ivan's place must be searched first, too.

 • MOVE to ROOM 202
 • KNOCK
 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE any option (x7)
 • KNOCK (x3)
 • TALK (x2)

 Gillian is let inside by Freddy's significant other, Lisa.

 • LOOK at LISA (x3)
 • TALK about FREDDY AS A SUSPECT (x2)
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > PHOTO > MONTAGE PHOTO
 • ASK ABOUT FREDDY (x2)
 • ASK ABOUT FREDDY's RECENT BEHAVIOR, HEALTH and OCCUPATION, then ALIBI
 • LOOK at WALL, then INVESTIGATE the MAP
 • ASK about MEANING OF MAP and SNEEZE
 • TALK about MONTAGE

 The detectives step into the bathroom...

 • INVESTIGATE the BATHTUB
 • LOOK AROUND ROOM, and at the BATHTUB, SHELF and MIRROR
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the BOTTLE

 Gillian will then be attacked by an actual snatcher! They're fought in the
 same manner as insectors; however, snatchers are only hurt by headshots! An
 accurate shot in this manner also negates the enemy's attack. After five hits
 the robotic rapscallion is history.

 • LOOK AT and INVESTIGATE REMAINS (automatically leave apartment)
 • INVESTIGATE the DOOR, LOCK, then any other option (x3)
 • OPEN DOOR
 • Any option (x6)
 • ENTER BATHROOM

 There'll be a scene and a struggle, where Gillian faces off with the final
 snatcher. The only way to end the fight is to aim directly upward (top-middle)
 and fire a few times, which cues a scene with Random Hajile and his info
 "acquisition" from Gibson. This ends the first Act! Save at the prompt, yo.

_______________________________________________________________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
02) ACT 2: CURE                                                          [WLK2]
_______________________________________________________________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 This act will involve locating the snatchers' hospital. As one soon finds out,
 a lot of items and locations no longer pertinent to this chapter are removed.
 The default stuff is Gillian's ID, cash, and the chess piece; default places
 are just Gillian's Apartment and HQ. Almost like starting from scratch.

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 The duo recounts the events of the first Act to the Chief back at HQ, and
 the boss mentions that Little John's memory may provide a clue to the clinic's
 location.

 • MOVE to ENGINEERING ROOM (Video Memory acquired)

 Here, the only image salvagable from the databank is a picture that says:
 Hospital Oleen. Harry suggests looking the place up on Jordan, but as Metal's
 quick to mention en route, there's no such function. Instead, he thinks our
 old informant can shed some light on the subject...

 • USE METAL GEAR's VIDEOPHONE > 39-5644
 • ANSWER PASSWORD > either REIGN or IS ENDED

 The "usual place" is, of course, Alton Plaza.

ALTON PLAZA
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • LOOK at AREA, then SANTA CLAUS
 • INVESTIGATE the SANTA CLAUS
 • ASK about ILLICIT HOSPITAL (x2)

 Napoleon mentions that all pharmaceuticals are manufactured on the island,
 so the hospital is probably in the city. Furthermore, Jamie works for Kobe
 Pharmaceuticals, so she might be able to help. (HINT, HINT)

 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > VIDEO MEMORY > LITTLE JOHN
 • ASK about OLEEN
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > CASH
 • ASK about OLEEN, then OLEEN HOSPITAL
 • POSSESSIONS > USE > CASH
 • ASK about OLEEN HOSPITAL and SNOW-9

 Napoleon then takes his magical bag of toys and leaves. Like the previous
 visit, there's a few extra things to do here. Simply looking around will give
 observations on Christmastime, and having to spend the holidays with Metal
 being "the worst-case scenario." Metal will suggest leaving to visit Oleen
 Hospital, but if you keep looking around the area, there'll be a hilarious
 scene involving a ramen shop. But anyway, the new destination is added to
 the turbocycle menu...

OLEEN HOSPITAL
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • LOOK at HOSPITAL, BILLBOARD, WINDOW, NEON SIGN and DOOR
 • INVESTIGATE the HOSPITAL and WINDOW
 • MOVE > GO INSIDE

 Gillian soon finds that this hospital ain't what he expected...

 • INVESTIGATE AROUND ROOM
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the RECEPTION DESK
 • LOOK at the NEARBY PEOPLE
 • LOOK > SMALL ANIMALS > PARROT, PENGUIN, DOG and CAT
 • ASK ABOUT SNATCHERS, HOSPITAL'S SPECIALTY (x2), then HOSPITAL'S DOCTOR
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > VIDEO MEMORY > LITTLE JOHN

 The partners leave once they realize it's just a simple veterinary clinic.
 That makes the only usable lead Jamie, although this isn't that obvious (the
 Chief nudges the player in this direction, if asked). For what it's worth,
 this location can't be visited again.

 • USE METAL GEAR > VIDEOPHONE > 39-3444

 Jamie's pre-recorded message will says he's at work, and can be reached at
 the Kobe Pharmaceuticals building (39-1009). A funny tidbit: if you call the
 -1009 number first without seeing Jamie's funny message, the call won't go
 through. Gotta do it in order! [Unlike some previous numbers...]

 • ASK about UV HOSPITAL

 That's the only mandatory option to pick, but it's fun to chit-chat with the
 wife. If Gillian asked Jamie out on a date in the previous chapter, she'll
 allude to it here.

 The next time Gillian returns to the turbocycle, he'll get an urgent message
 from Mika saying that Katrina may be imperiled. [Note: if Gillian called his
 wife from HQ, he'll have to get in the turbocycle, go elsewhere, exit and
 re-enter to get the emergency summons.] Once the message is received, it's
 the only location one can visit.

GIBSON'S HOUSE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • KNOCK
 • INVESTIGATE the DOOR
 • MOVE > GO INSIDE
 • INVESTIGATE the WINDOW, then the SHELF
 • LOOK AT and INVESTIGATE the MODEL
 • MOVE to the BACKYARD GARDEN
 • LOOK at the AREA, THE SHADOWS, GROUND and COLLAR
 • INVESTIGATE the AREA, THE SHADOWS and COLLAR
 • MOVE back to the STUDY
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE AROUND ROOM, PC68, and SOFA
 • LOOK at or INVESTIGATE anything else (x1) to have Gillian sneeze
 • CALL for KATRINA and ALICE (in any room but the Study)
 • MOVE to the STUDY

 There'll be a scene involving a window breaking, and Gibson'll automatically
 leave to look for Katrina. This is one instance where it's good to have such
 few options at the turbocycle, eh?

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • SEARCH FOR KATRINA (x3)
 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE DOWNTOWN, the SHOP WINDOWS or NEARBY PEOPLE (x5 total)

 Metal should notify Gillian that Katrina doesn't appear to be here. Still,
 if you continue to search, Metal will recite some videophone numbers that're
 of little to no use: the Snatcher hotline (256-128), police department (911),
 fire department (119) and weather forecast (177). Fun little curios, but they
 aren't recorded in Metal's memory banks.

 As for the continuing search, if Katrina was at HQ, Gillian would have been
 notified, yeah? So, that only leaves the remaining spot...

GILLIAN'S APARTMENT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Something seems amiss when the lights in Gillian's pad are on...hmm...

 • LOOK at GILLIAN'S ROOM
 • INVESTIGATE the DOOR
 • MOVE > GO INSIDE
 • LOOK at FLOOR
 • INVESTIGATE FOOTPRINTS
 • LISTEN and SMELL
 • MOVE > ENTER BATHROOM
 • LOOK AROUND ROOM
 • INVESTIGATE SHOWER BOOTH (x4)
 • OPEN BOOTH

 And then the hideous intruder is revealed!!

 • ASK ABOUT VIDEOPHONE
 • INVESTIGATE the HOSPITAL LIST (x2)

 Gillian can then search Metal's databanks for a name similar to Oleen, which
 will narrow down the list of 3,000 names. Gillian will have to think of a
 name similar to Oleen's block lettering, and repeated wrong answers will earn
 clues, such as "there may be letters missing from the picture" and "what if
 part of the neon sign is burnt out like the one in Alton Plaza". Repeated
 wrong answers will hint that the chess piece might be releated...if that
 doesn't spell it out, you might have brain sepsis!

 • INVESTIGATE LIST > QUEENS
 • INVESTIGATE LIST > HOSPITAL'S ADDRESS

 And with that, the next destination is set.

QUEENS HOSPITAL
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • INVESTIGATE the BUILDING, then the DOOR
 • GO INSIDE
 • LOOK at AREA
 • INVESTIGATE the DOORS and RECEPTION DESK, then the SWITCHES
 • USE SWITCHES > SWITCH 1, SWITCH 2 and SWITCH 3

 All doors should now be open.

 • MOVE to DOOR 3
 • USE METAL GEAR > TURN ON LIGHT
 • INVESTIGATE the drawer behind the desk
 • INVESTIGATE the matchbook on the table (entered into evidence)
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the Cathedral of St. Basil portrait

 There's some other stuff to look at, like a whiteboard and such, but it's
 not that important right now. The main clue is the scrap of paper in the
 drawer, which contains obscure Chinese characters. If only there was someone
 who could read those characters... [Showing the Patient Record to colleagues
 will nudge one in Napoleon's direction.]

 • USE METAL GEAR > VIDEOPHONE > 39-5644

 The out-of-order notification seems out of place though, and Gillian notices
 the wolfman looks like the guy from Outer Heaven. And whaddaya know, it's
 now an accessible location from the turbocycle.

OUTER HEAVEN
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • TALK (x2)
 • INTERROGATE (x2)
 • GIVE PROOF > BODY TYPE, VOCAL PATTERN, ACCENT, PERSONALITY and SMELL
 • GIVE PROOF > SNEEZE
 • ASK about NAPOLEON'S BACKGROUND
 • POSSESSIONS > SHOW > PATIENT RECORD
 • ASK > MEANING OF CODE

 Napoleon says the characters represent elements from the periodic table. From
 left to right: beryllium, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen again. Metal
 figures out the code almost immediately.

 • INFER > BENSON

 The key to the code lies in the elements' English abbreviations. Putting in
 tons of wrong answers earns clues from Metal, and maybe a bit of annoyance,
 too. Once the name's been uncovered, the finger-pointing leads back to one
 of Gillian's own... Dire straits, these be!

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Both possible suspects are out right now, so let the investigation begin!

 • TALK about CONTENTS OF PATIENT RECORD
 • ASK ABOUT HARRY > HARRY'S WHEREABOUTS and HARRY'S CONDITION
 • ASK ABOUT CHIEF > CHIEF'S WHEREABOUTS and CHIEF'S CONDITION
 • ASK about KYOTO SUMMIT
 • MOVE to ENGINEERING ROOM
 • LOOK at DESK TOP
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the MATCHES and MEMO (memo entered into evidence)
 • MOVE to CHIEF'S OFFICE
 • LOOK at PICTURE
 • INVESTIGATE the PICTURE (x2)
 • LOOK at and INVESTIGATE the PHOTO
 • MOVE to FRONT > ENTER TURBOCYCLE

 Jamie will call upon entering, revealing that records show Queens Hospital
 had basement work done decades earlier. After picking the destination, the
 'cycle will undergo some...car trouble. [You can pick no destination except
 the clinic at this point.]

 • PULL EMERGENCY LEVER
 • JUMP OUT or GIVE UP (x4 total)
 • HIT CLIFF           -.
 • DRIVE INTO SANDPILE  |- This is the shortest way to get the Pray to God
 • PRESS BUTTON        -'  option, but you can try any new option twice to
 • PRAY TO GOD             unlock it as well.
 • HIT CONTROL PANEL
 
 Enjoy the scene!

QUEENS HOSPITAL
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Our new friend'll join the team for these proceedings...

 • MOVE > GO INSIDE
 • MOVE > DOOR 3
 • USE METAL GEAR > TURN ON LIGHT
 • LOOK at the floor rails, then the desk vase
 • INVESTIGATE the vase
 • PEEP
 • INVESTIGATE the STAIRWAY and MOTION DETECTOR

 Once in the basement...

 • INVESTIGATE the RECEPTION DESK, then SWITCHES
 • USE SWITCHES > SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2
 • MOVE to DOOR 1
 • LOOK OVER
 • LOOK & INVESTIGATE all available options at least once
 • LOOK OVER

 A snatcher will appear at this point. Draw your blaster and aim for the top-
 -central part of its head to terminate its functions. After a small scene,
 shoot the snatcher a few times in its abdomen to end its functions (Metal,
 I thought you said they were terminated the FIRST time! Argh!).

 • EXIT and MOVE to DOOR 2
 • LOOK at SHELF, then the revealed CONTAINERS
 • INVESTIGATE the SHELF, CEILING, DESK TOP and MONITORS
 • EXIT
 • INVESTIGATE the SWITCHES (maybe twice if not done earlier?)
 • USE SWITCHES > 1 AND 2 AT SAME TIME
 • MOVE to DOOR 3
 • LOOK AROUND ROOM, then the WALL, REMAINS and DUCT
 • INVESTIGATE the REMAINS and its ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH
 • INVESTIGATE the CAUSE OF DEATH, then the body's IDENTITY
 • RECONSTRUCT CORPSE

 There'll be a very long scene, and then...

AIR DUCT / ABANDONED UNDERGROUND
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 There's no real order to do the next part in, mind you.

 • USE METAL GEAR > TURN ON LIGHT
 • LOOK at WALL
 • INVESTIGATE the CEILING (x2)
 • INVESTIGATE the SCRATCHES (x2)
 • INVESTIGATE the GROUND (x3), then its SAND (x2)
 • INVESTIGATE the POLLEN (available after Gillian sneezes (inv. 6-7 options))

 Save your game at this point!

 • ADVANCE

 There'll be a bunch of insectors to take care of down the line, and there's
 a lot more than seen previously. In fact, many people have claimed this is
 one of the most annoying parts of the entire game! This may be because most
 people playing are emulating, and many have found the reticle sticks in some
 of the corners when shooting, usually allowing Gillian to be wounded. Either
 way, the insectors come fast and furiously, so use the blaster's rapid-fire
 capabilities to your advantage (no reloading remember!).

 • LOOK at the FRONT, then BEHIND
 • LISTEN (x3)
 • TALK (x3)

FREDDY'S APARTMENT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 So that's where the secret passage is! Funny that they're three stories up
 but there's easy ladder access...that probably irks the neighbors below!

 • MOVE and GO TO LIVING ROOM
 • LOOK or INVESTIGATE the MAP
 • EXIT
 • LOOK at the AREA
 • INVESTIGATE the TAXI
 • MOVE > RIDE IN TAXI
 • TELL DESTINATION (x3)

 Gillian will have to go all "Travis Bickle" on the taxi driver, so shoot him
 once in the face to end his reign o' terror. [At least Metal made a joke out
 of it...you silly robot, you!]

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 Hmm, these tidings be grim...

 • INVESTIGATE the SHUTTER
 • LOOK and INVESTIGATE the AREA, DOOR, and BOOTH
 • OPEN SHUTTER

 In the hallway, there'll be another scene. Now it's time to search for the
 snatcher culprit! Don't be fooled -- hardcore searching of each room isn't
 necessary.

 • MOVE to all rooms at least once (Hallway doesn't count)
 • MOVE to the CHIEF'S OFFICE
 • LOOK at the DESK
 • LOOK at, then INVESTIGATE, the STAIN ON DESK
 • SEARCH the CEILING

 There'll be a short battle. Shoot the snatcher once for a small scene. It'll
 have vanished in the quick power outage. The search begins anew...

 • MOVE to all rooms (excluding CHIEF'S OFFICE)
 • MOVE to HALLWAY
 • MOVE to FRONT

 The final battle of Act 2 will commence now. The snatcher will use Mika as a
 shield, which means Gillian can only hit it when it's in the screen's corners.
 Hitting Mika -- which shouldn't ever happen, really -- decreases one's health,
 and slaying her is an automatic game over. Either way, five headshots will
 dispose of the creeper and finish the segment.

 Just like any good movie, the third act is pretty short, and doesn't dawdle
 about bringing a resolution. It's the most cinematic of 'em all, too.

JUNKER HEADQUARTERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 A short recap will commence after a scene, where Gillian answers questions.

 • ULTRAVIOLET RAYS
 • UNDERPASS
 • SNEEZE
 • SNOW-9
 • MOSCOW
 • ENTER TURBOCYCLE > CHURCH

 With a little ingenuity, it's time to assault the snatchers' HQ! Exploring
 other places, as you'd expect, is not possible.

CHURCH
¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • INVESTIGATE the BUILDING and AREA
 • GO INSIDE
 • LOOK at the PORTRAIT
 • INVESTIGATE the PORTRAIT and AREA
 • CONTINUE BACK
 • LOOK at AREA
 • INVESTIGATE the CONTAINER
 • LOOK and INVESTIGATE the SNATCHER
 • INVESTIGATE the AREA
 • CONTINUE BACK
 • LOOK at the CYLINDER, then SNATCH PROCESS
 • LOOK and INVESTIGATE the AREA (reveals Terminal and Door, respectively)
 • LOOK and INVESTIGATE the DOOR
 • INVESTIGATE the CYLINDER and TERMINAL

 To do the transmission, Metal will have to leave; this means there's no saving
 past this point! [People emulating can still use save states, though.] Either
 way, Gillian immediately advances toward the Act's climax. First things first,
 though, it's time for battles!

 The first set of battles is against, well, "super insectors". These are just
 like normal ones, except they do pull feints -- they jump towards one spot
 but land elsewhere. They don't all do this, but needless to say, when there's
 a crapload on the screen, the distraction's enough to let Gillian be damaged.
 The button-mashing rapid-fire option does help, and there's still the fact
 that when Gillian's damaged, the opposition can't capitalize on the face (the
 damage is nulled for 1-1.5 seconds or so). People emulating will probably
 want to save-state here, as dying in the next fight restarts the whole series
 of fights.

 Immediately afterwards, Gillian will square off with a horde of snatchers.
 This fight tends to be easier, mostly because they only appear on-screen one
 at a time. Of course, if a player's made it this far, s/he is aware these
 meddling mechs can only be neutralized with a headshot -- anything else will
 be ineffective. Snatchers' attacks do more damage than insectors, so there's
 less room for error where reaction time is concerned -- the button-mashing
 strategy should be shelved for pinpoint accuracy. There's about thirty to
 kill.

 For the last battle, don't fire at all. There'll be a VERY long set of scenes
 from here on (about a half hour in length), before the finale sets in.

 • LOOK at JAMIE
 • TALK to MIKA (x3)
 • TALK to KATRINA (x4)
 • TALK to JAMIE (x2)
