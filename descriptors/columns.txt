This section is just a look over all things in the game without going too
in-depth.

------------
2.01. Basics
------------

Columns is a basic puzzle game that's similar to Tetris. Columns of different
coloured or shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen, and you can
change the order of these blocks as they fall. When that column rests on the
bottom or above another column, you take control of another column that will
fall. 

The aim is to match up three or more of the same shape or colour
blocks, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. When you have, they
will disappear and points will be added to your score, and the blocks you just
got rid of adds to your block total. The blocks above then fall down to rest 
where the old ones were.

The longer you play the higher the levels get - the higher the level, the
faster the columns will fall. You will keep on going until the blocks the
reach the very top of the screen, and when that happens, its game over.

------------
Magic Column
------------

Once you have made 300 blocks disappear, then you will get a magic column. This
is a special column that when it lands on a block, all those of the same type
are destroyed on the screen , regardless of location. For example landing the
magic column on a red block clears the screen of red blocks.

------------------------
Changing the Block Order
------------------------

There are two ways to change the block order using the two buttons. Using
button I you can cycle the blocks upward, and using button II you can cycle
the buttons down. Here are some diagrams to show this -

By pressing BUTTON I twice...

 ##              --              ==
 --     --->     ==     --->     ##
 ==              ##              --

By pressing BUTTON II twice...

 ##              ==              --
 --     --->     ##     --->     ==
 ==              --              ##

--------------
2.02. Controls
--------------

Being a puzzle game, there isn't a lot to the controls...

D-Pad     -  Move Columns / select different menu items 

Button I  -  Changes block order upward

Button II -  Changes block order down

                                3. ONE PLAYER
===============================================================================

There are two modes within One Player. The Original and Flash modes.

--------------
3.01. Original
--------------

This is the main mode of Columns where you play for points.

Options
-------

Before you start your game, there are a number of options that you can alter
as you please. You will be asked this every time before you play. To change
use the D-pad, then to proceed to playing the game press any button.

Top Score:  This is your top score. Sadly they are not saved onto the cart, 
            so when you switch the game off your scores are erased.

Difficulty: You can change the difficulty here. You can change it to either 
            EASY, NORMAL, or HARD. The difference between each one is that with
            EASY there will be a range of 4 blocks, with NORMAL a range of 5, 
            and HARD a range of 6.

Level:      This changes the speed that the blocks come down at. You can set it
            from 0 to 9 where 0 is very slow and 9 is lightning fast.

Sound:      There are three different music tunes you can have while you play.
            Pick either A, B or C.

Blocks:     Change the types of blocks you play with. You can choose from -

            Blocks
            Gems
            Playing Card Symbols
            Dice
            Fruit

            The game doesn't change based on your choice. Although I think the 
            Blocks are easiest to play with as they are simple block designs 
            that are only different in colour.

 3.02. Flash
------------

In this mode, you have several rows of blocks to begin with and a flashing
block that's in the bottom row. This block flashes and is a colour, just like
any other block. You have to work your way down to this block and destroy it,
then you win that game.

Options:    Before you start your game, there are a number of options that you
            can alter as you please. You will be asked this every time before 
            you play. To change use the D-pad, then to proceed to playing the
            game press any button.

Best Time:  This is your best time that you got destroyed the flashing block 
            with. Sadly they are not saved onto the cart, so when you switch 
            the game off your best time is erased.

Difficulty: You can change the difficulty here. You can change it to either 
            EASY, NORMAL, or HARD. The difference between each one is that with
            EASY there will be a range of 4 blocks, with NORMAL a range of 5, 
            and HARD a range of 6.

High:       This is how high the columns are when you begin. The lowest us 2, 
            and the highest is 9.

Sound:      There are three different music tunes you can have while you play.
            Pick either A, B or C.

Blocks:     Change the types of blocks you play with. You can choose from -

            Blocks
            Gems
            Playing Card Symbols
            Dice
            Fruit

            The game doesn't change based on your choice. Although I think the 
            Blocks are easiest to play with as they are simple block designs 
            that are only different in colour.

                                 4. VERSUS
===============================================================================

I haven't actually played a two player with a friend, so the only information
that I can provide is that from the manual. If you have played this in versus
mode and have further information then please email me details about this and
I will add it into the FAQ.

Versus mode allows you to play against an friend. You will need a Game Gear
each, a copy of Columns each, and a link cable. You can play both original and
flash games in versus mode; however the twist is that you can add horizontal
lines onto your opponents screen by destroying blocks. If you clear four
blocks or two columns disappear then you add a single line to your opponents
screen; if you clear five blocks or three columns disappear then you add two
lines to your opponents. ALSO you don't just add a line your shift it from
your side to theirs (so if you have 3 lines and they have 1, then you both have
2 as you shifted one of yours to their side). The column that is falling also
will disappear when a line is added.

                              5. HINTS AND TIPS
===============================================================================

--------------------
Basic Hints and Tips
--------------------

• When you are picking your options, pick a block type that you can easily
  identify when you are combining during game play.
• When you are more experienced at playing, try more complex combos to get
  higher scores (see the section below).
• Keep a close eye on what is coming next, so you can organise what can go
  where in a more suitable way.
• Don't panic - especially later on when the levels increase. Also, unless you
  are very good, keep combos simpler in the later levels.
• Playing on higher levels means you get more points.
• Most of all, practice makes perfect. But if no one is perfect, why practice?
  Hmmm. OK - the more you play, the better you get, just like in any game.
  Especially puzzle games... ;)

----------------------------------------
Getting more than three blocks per combo
----------------------------------------

You can get combos that are more than three blocks. They don't have to be
in a direct line either, they can stray from the line itself. If there
are two blocks leading from a block, that's a combo - if one of them blocks
has another two coming from it, it adds to the combo. Confused? ASCII time.

These are standard three in a line combos -
   __    __ __ __    __                __
  |__|  |__|__|__|  |__|__          __|__|
  |__|                 |__|__    __|__|
  |__|                    |__|  |__|

As you can see, each one of these blocks is connected to two others. That's
how the game recognises a combo. So you could have more than one block
connected to two others, and if you do, you get a bigger combo, meaning more
blocks are cleared and you get a better score. Here is a few examples -
 __ __ __          __    __    __
|__|__|__|__      |__|__|__|  |__|__ __
         |__|__   |__|__|__   |__|__|__|
            |__|  |__|  |__|  |__|

So when you playing, keep this in mind to get higher scores.

                                   6. FAQ'S
===============================================================================

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Q. Why do my scores / times not saved!?

A. This game does not have battery backup, meaning that when you switch it off
   your scores and times are gone. Forever. Its a shame really...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Q. How do I play Versus mode?

A. You need an extra game gear, an extra copy of Columns and a link cable.
   Seeing as this game is now fairly old, getting these items might be a tad
   tricky and could prove expensive... but if you still want to go for it, then
   I recommend something like eBay.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Q. Are they any secrets or Easter Eggs or anything?

A. Yes there is. You can get an Alternate Ending. To see this alternate ending,
   Start a new game in flash mode that is on normal difficulty and the height
   at normal. Now quit the game after the demonstration mode to see the
   alternate ending. Thanks to havok6188 for submitting this in the codes
   section of GameFAQs.
